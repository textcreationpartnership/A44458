         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> is well known that, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator, would not eſtabliſh (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all others) a Law againſt Ingratitude, <hi>Quòd prodigioſa res eſſet, benificium non repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> and of all ingenious ſpirits, it was ever accounted monſtrous, to make ſlight of favours, and eaſily forget Priſtine benefits; for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of favours, makes all favour void, and ſhould I come under this ſenſure, by my diſ-ingenuous and impolite carriage, I might from you juſtly incur the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb facs="tcp:32632:4"/> title of an ingrateful perſon: Your complicated kindneſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon me, do perpetually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me, whilſt not being capable of ſutable returns, yet to publiſh my humble acknowledgements of them, and if the Laws of God and Nature injoyne and require the homage of due reſpects to be given unto our earthly Parents, I know no Reaſon or Law which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts from attributing the like to our Spiritual. It was the ſaying of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that as we have our being from our Parents, we have our well being from our inſtructors, and if he could eſteem himſelf happy for terrene knowledge, how much more then ought I for that Divine, in which you have been my Teacher; and if that earthy knowledge may ſo much conduce to a well being here, what will Celeſtial Science do, but ſafely
<pb facs="tcp:32632:4"/> carry the Soul to an everlaſting Weal, a happy being, which never knows end to terminate its ſatiate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abounding comforts. <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſhall not bluſh to own, or be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to declare, that (which I know to you, is matter of joy) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have had many Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors) you are he that has begotten me unto Chriſt; and I may truly call you, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did <hi>Cecilius, Vitae novae patrem,</hi> your ſweet invitations and divine Rhetorick (being accompanied with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed influences of Heaven) drew me out of the Womb of this world, and from the power of Satan, into the gracious imbraces of the Lord Jeſus, it was eternally the deſign of the Father, but you were the Inſtrument (by the Word and Spirit) in time to call me home to Chriſt. Moreover, you did not only beget me to a ſecond birth,
<pb facs="tcp:32632:5"/> but alſo conſtantly entertained me with thoſe heavenly dainties, with which Chriſt does nouriſh his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ones. But to add to theſe the remembrance of your private inſtructions and care for me, are not to be obliterated by Times ſwift Motion, or Diurnal viciſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and mutations. But Sir, as an addition to the former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I have here preſumed to prefix your Name, and make a-Dedication of this little Treatiſe to your ſelf, not for your Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but a manifeſtation of my ſubmiſsive reſpects due to you.</p>
            <p>I know that I have here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed my ſelf and labours to the view of no leſs a cenſuring, than a ſinning Generation, therefore by your favourable Aſpect, it may in ſome meaſure abate (if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together prevent) the hard ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a calumniating world. It is
<pb facs="tcp:32632:5"/> too perſpicuous that our Age a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with ſuch, who ſtudy more to carpe at, than gather the ſweet fruits of the Goſpel; but <hi>Momo ſatisfacere,</hi> would be an endleſs work; therefore, if I can but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the Lord Jeſus, and help im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls to glory. I ſhall not value the foul aſperſions of a dirty World, for in this Generation, there are ſuch, who will not ſpare the talleſt Cedars in the Lebanon of God, much leſs the loweſt ſhrubs. Therefore, I will not fondly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my ſelf better entertainment then Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and his faithful Labourers have ever met with. Neither do I ſo much addreſs my ſelf unto you, to ſhroud me from the frowns, or hereby to ſilence the perverſe ſayings of Men, as that I would ſtudy to declare my gratitude, in humble acknowledgements, and thankful
<pb facs="tcp:32632:6"/> returns, like gliding ſtreams, that ſwiftly move toward the abounding Ocean, from whence their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſprang. I am not ignorant that the world is copiouſly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Books, yet theſe <hi>Muti Magiſtri</hi> (as <hi>Alphonſus</hi> called them) are not totally in vain, for I have extracted benefit from ſome of them, which I hope others may do from this. I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to caſt my might into the Treaſury, and my grain into the field, leaving the increaſe unto God.<note place="margin">

               </note> This Book I may call my Primitiee, for when the Lord firſt called me forth to publiſh the Goſpel, he ſent me with this Meſſage, to call and invite Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto Chriſt, which found entertainment with ſome then, wherefore it gives me ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of encouragement that it will not prove now as water ſpilt upon
<pb facs="tcp:32632:6"/> the ground. I was unwilling for a time to ſuffer it to ſee the light, being conſcious of my own defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and imperfections, but at laſt being prevailed with by ſome, and having it long by me, I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſend it forth into the world, although not inveſted with ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did cloathing of rhetorical Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet I truſt (like pure Gold) it will bear the Touchſtone of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine verity, and ſo prove for the advancement of Gods glory, the exaltation of the Lord Jeſus, and the Salvation of immortal Souls. All which I am certain are the ardent deſires of your Soul, and that theſe may receive a gracious anſwer, with all true proſperity to you and yours, ſhall be the ſincere and conſtant requeſts of him who will for ever acknowledge, a firm obligation to ſubſcribe himſelf,</p>

Now this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one, is he that makes free tenders of himſelf to periſhing ſinners, condeſcends ſo, as to invite the infirm, laboring, and heavy laden, to come unto him, who alone give reſt. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which I have fixed, doth ſufficiently demonſtrate <hi>Chriſts</hi> abundant willingneſs to receive and eaſe poor wounded and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Mortals. And who is there that has not an abſolute neceſſity of accepting ſuch offers of Peace and Mercy? are not all by actual ſin wounded? by original ſin contaminated and polluted? by multiplied tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,

What more delectable than Divine imbraces? what more excellent than celeſtial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? what more deſirable than reſt and comfort for the weary and diſconſolate Soul? all which is to be found in Chriſt, and he that ſeeks unto him, ſhall certainly obtain, for he is the Divine Treaſurer, who has all neceſſaries to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate;

There is not any thing which may conduce to thy everlaſting benefit, but Chriſt has rich ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and is ready to extend to all indigent and humble men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants, and ſeeing thou mayſt have for asking, and receive for coming, let this Treatiſe lead thee by the hand to the
<pb facs="tcp:32632:10"/> Lord Jeſus; for Chriſt ſayes come, and thy miſeries (if thou conſulteſt thy Soul) ſay go, or thou art undone: it may be that through ſome ſtratagems of Satan, thou art prevented from getting into Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have here laid open thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two of them, and I think, the moſt ſubtleſt of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Baits; and I have alſo (in a weak meaſure) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured (though in brief) to invalidate and diſcover the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them.

<pb facs="tcp:32632:11"/> grew bigger then I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, therefore I was forced to contract in ſome things, and in fine to draw up thoſe things which I thought largely to handle, into a very narrow compaſs. But Reader, pardon my abruptneſs, for I deſign'd this piece for a common good, that the meaneſt ſort might be able, as well as willing, (if any be ſo) to purchaſe it; and this I would further intreat of thee, (if thou pleaſeſt to ſpend thy labour) read with an unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced and impartial mind, with a deſign to profit, if thou haſt not already made ſuch a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency (as ſome perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) that thou needeſt no further inſtruction; do not read it as too many go to hear Sermons, to wit, that they may judge of them, not thinking

               </note> (ſaith he) it is a worſhip which extends to God as our preſent good.

            <p n="3">3ly, For councel, Chriſt doth graciouſly invite, therefore I would councel you to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; let not Chriſt Jeſus call and intreat in vain; he invites to come without Mony, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Price, come though poor; he has riches for you,<note place="margin">

            <p>Some Motives to inforce this word of Councel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider if thou comeſt not now he intreats, thou wilt declare great diſingenuity and ingratitude; has Chriſt conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended ſo far as to intreat thee, manifeſted ſo much Love as to call after thee, and wilt thou not return? what is there no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation? no imbracing his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers? this was the great Sin of the Jews,<note place="margin">

               </note> O what horrid ingratitude is this, for ſuch unparralled love, Salvation offered, but they put it from them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.16. This (I ſay) was their Sin, &amp; baſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs

                  </gap>, The Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians do pervert this Text.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He willeth all men to be ſaved.</hi> So the words may be read, and they have relation to the foregoing verſes, where the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:32632:66"/> to pray for all degrees of Men, for Kings and thoſe in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for God willeth all Men, all ſorts of Men to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Salvation, for he is no reſpecter of Perſons, in that ſence, but he that feareth God and worketh Righteouſneſs, and believeth in his Son, ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth the Son hath Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Prop.</hi> Is, that it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all to make uſe of means in order to the attaining of this great end, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Salvation of their Souls; God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the means as well as the end; and he hath injoyned it as our Duty to make uſe of the means, God hath given his Son to dye for us, and doth command us to come and believe in him, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.33.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Prop.</hi> is, that Chriſt Jeſus is the only way for ſinners to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal life by, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is no other name given under heaven whereby we can be ſaved,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:32632:67"/> therefore I ſay, it is the duty of all that expect ſalvation to look and return unto, to accept of, and believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That they may obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and an Inheritance of eternal Glory among thoſe who are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt,</hi> 2. Theſ. 2.13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God the Father hath given his ſon for this very end, that Sinners coming to, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of him, might have life and reſt from him. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> Now ſeeing this is the end of God, it is our duty therefore to cloſe with it, for there is no coming to the Father but by the Son, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.6. So much for the confirmation of the point: if all ought to ſeek the happineſs of their Souls, and in order thereunto, uſe the means, which is coming to, and apprehending of Chriſt, which is the Fathers will, and end, in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32632:67"/> ſending his Son, then it is a duty to come, but it is clear from the word of God that it is ſo; therefore neglect not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to come unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall make manifeſt many of theſe obſtructions which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and hinder Sinners from coming to the Lord Jeſus (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is their duty) and alſo ſhew the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them all, which is the main thing intended in this Doctrine.<note place="margin">Sinners make theſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to themſelves they are not effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental cauſes.</note> 1. <hi>Ab extra.</hi> 2. <hi>Ab intra;</hi> Lets from without, and from within. 1.

So it was with the Jews, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.42. <hi>And they ſaid, is not this Jeſus the Son of Joſeph, whoſe Father and Mother we know? and how is it then that he ſaith I came down from heaven?</hi> Chriſt preached his divine Original, but they ſtumbled at it, becauſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32632:68"/> he was not of noble Parentage, <hi>Praeclarum eſt à principibus naſci, It is an excellent thing to be the progeny of Princes.</hi> They did not conſider that it was for their ſakes that he became low, and although he was in the form of God, yet for their ſakes he came in the form of a ſervant. Chriſt put himſelf into this capacity that he might ſuffer for ſin, and make an attonement to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. Chriſt inſtead of being to them the Rock that ſhould ſave them, was made by them a Rock of offence; and as it was with them, ſo it is with too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in our days, who are ready to ſay, how can he who was born of a poor Virgin ſave or ſuccour us? They will not ſearch and believe that Teſtimony God hath given of his Son, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuſe him not for thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or becauſe he made himſelf of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32632:68"/> no reputation, for it was the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Heaven, that Chriſt ſhould come in that way, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. The Poverty of his life.<note place="margin">Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
               <hi>As Chriſt ſaith, the Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man hath not wherein to lay his head: he was ſo poor, that others were fain to Miniſter of their ſuſtenauce to him,</hi> Mat. 27.56. Now for this cauſe alſo the Jews rejected him, for they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be ſome potent and honourable one in the earth, and that he ſhould reſtore the Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, then under the Roman Bondage. This is ſome hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance I fear at this day; for if Chriſt were an Earthly Prince, and would give them terrene In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, how would perſons flock to him? but they do not conſider that he became poor, that he might make many rich,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32632:69"/> and bring many Sons and Daughters to glory; therefore let not this keep thee back, for he hath riches in abundance for thee, riches of grace and glory, for he is the heir of all things, <hi>He created them, and by him they do ſubſiſt,</hi> Coll. 1.16.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Ignominy of his death, becauſe he dyed a curſed, painful, and ſhameful death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.39. They reviled him, ſaying, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs.</hi> v. 42. <hi>He ſaved others, himſelf be cannot ſave. If he be the King of Iſrael, let him come down from the Croſs, and we will believe in him:</hi> Thus much we may gather from theſe words, that becauſe they ſaw Chriſt dye ſuch a curſed death, therefore they conclude that he was not the Son of God, and ſo conſequently not the promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> They made that the Obſtacle to their faith, which ſhould have been the chief ground of their faith, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the death and ſuffering of the Lord
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32632:69"/> Jeſus, for had not he willingly conſented to dye that curſed death, and to be made a curſe for ſinners, they muſt all have been curſed to all eternity, <hi>Gall.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</note> 3.10. Thus ſome in our days make a ſcoff, and revile him who dyed without the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and trample his blood under their feet as being nothing worth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. Therefore they will not believe in him, becauſe he yeilded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and humbled himſelf unto death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. Even the death of the Croſs, which had a curſe annexed to it, and this Chriſt did ſuffer, not as a Malefactor himſelf, nor for any example only, but he gave himſelf a Ranſom for many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As many ſtumble at the perſon of Chriſt, his mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, his poverty of life, and his curſed death, ſo alſo at the Doctrine of Chriſt.

The plainneſs of his Doctrine, this was an offence to them, notwithſtanding, his words were more ſweet than the hony, and the hony-comb, <hi>He was full of grace and truth, Jo.</hi> 1.14. And his Doctrine was gracious, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.22 <hi>They won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the Gratious words which proceeded out of his Mouth.</hi> But yet we find ſome were &amp; are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the plainneſs of it; the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Phyloſophers were for high ſtrains and rhetorical floriſhes; they ſought earthly wiſdom, therefore they ſtumbled at Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.23.</note> and the pure plain ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpell; and how many ſuch Grecian Spirits have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:32632:70"/> we in our days; if the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt teach and preach the Goſpel with plainneſs to the capacity of the Vulger, that is an offence to many; when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, I uſe plainneſs of Speech. But I think if this be well conſidered, we ſhould not ſo much ſtand off from coming to Chriſt becauſe of this, for ſuppoſe a perſon was going a journy into a ſtrange Country, but knew not the way, and ſhould come into a great Wilderneſs where many Paths preſent themſelves, but he knew not which would bring him to his journnys end, and he meets a man there who knows the way very well, of whom he makes inquiry to know the right way, but this man anſwers in a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or Language he underſtands not, (notwithſtanding he could have anſwered him in his own Language) in the firſt place would not he look upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of him as unprofitable? in the ſecond place, &amp; would he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32632:71"/> not condemn him of cruelty and unmercifulneſs. Juſt thus it is between Miniſters of the Goſpel and poor ſinners, who are the travellers, and in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; there are many teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who propoſe various ways of Salvation, and the Miniſter of Chriſt is the man who meets the poor ſinner in this bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred condition, and he enquires of him, who knows the way to Sion, but he anſwereth in a Language he cannot underſtand, would not this ſavour of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and affected pride? is it not more grateful to ſpeak ſo as to be underſtanded by the inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party? yea certainly, and moſt profitable to the ſoul; therfore do not contemn Chriſts Doctrine or his Miniſters for preaching of it plainly, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoice; Chriſt hath taken ſuch care for thy ſoul, that the way to happineſs may be eaſily known if thou humbly ſeekeſt, and enquireſt into it. I have been told that a Learned divine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32632:71"/> who in his preaching uſed much plainneſs, and had done great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Goſpel, &amp; the good of ſouls: but it happened that ſome more curious than wiſe, reproached and ſcandalized him in ſecret, ſaying, he was no ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He always uſed ſuch a plain ſtile, he being informed of it by ſome freinds, prepares his Sermon for next Lords day, compoſed moſt of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and coming to preach, he takes his text, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers his Sermon in thoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; The people being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed (for few or none under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him) began to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, becauſe they came there to be inſtructed, but underſtood nothing, ſo he took an occaſion to ask them what they profited by that Sermon, and withall ſharply reproved them for their folly and madneſs, in cenſuring his plainneſs in preaching, which he intended only for their good. It was that kind of preaching the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:32632:72"/> moſt affected, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. And this if it be the pure Goſpel is the moſt effectual for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſinners unto Chriſt, there is the love, the Wiſdom, and the power of God, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Simplicity of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truths; therefore let not this hinder thee from coming to the Lord Jeſus, for undoubtedly he who gave to his Apoſtles all kinds of Tongues, could much more have ſo ſpoken himſelf, if it had been either for his or his Fathers glory, or the good of poor Souls.</p>

But I know this to be one of Satans devices to keep poor ſouls from coming to Chriſt. O ſaith he to the ſinner, there are none without their failings, and if you expect to be perfectly holy, you muſt be ſo in another world; obſerve the ſteps of thoſe that ſeem moſt preciſe, ſaith Satan, and you ſhall ſee that they ſin dayly, they are as proud as paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and as worldly as others; if you live in one ſin, they live in another; therefore be not ſo much concerned about your ſelf and about coming to Chriſt.

Go ſaith Chriſt, part with all, ſell all, and follow me; but he rather choſe to part with Chriſt and bid farewell to him; he went away, the Text ſaith, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, but we never read he came again repenting.

            <p n="20">20ly, Satan obſtructs by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Sinner of the mercy of God, what if thou doſt Sin, God is Merciful, he is full of Pity, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6.7. <hi>He is gracious and long ſuffering.</hi> Therefore queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not but thou wilt do well, &amp; we find this anſwer very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in their Mouths, when we come to ſet their Sins before them, and demand how they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be ſaved, ſeeing they live ſo in Sin, the anſwer is, God is merciful, and I hope he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my iniquities. By this wile of Satan the mercy of God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, and the Sinner undone for ever; it is true, that Gods mercys are infinite, and he is full of pitty and tenderneſs unto poor Creatures, but his mercy will not ſave without Chriſt. I ſhall not now enter into that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, whether or no God could ſave Sinners by his mercy alone, without any Conſideration of,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:32632:99"/> or relation unto the Lord Jeſus, but this I aſſert from Chriſts own words, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.6. That there is no coming to the Father but by the Son, no coming to him for mercy, pardon, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but by Chriſt alone. But conſider further, it is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan to thy Soul, and he deſigns only Cruelty, when he keeps thee in thy Sins, and yet flatters thee with hopes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; I do not write this to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any poor penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from finding mercy, but to bring deluded Sinners from the abuſe of it, and diſcovering the Wile of Satan, ſhewing them the only way to obtain it; for never think to be ſaved by his mercy, when thou haſt lived as long as thou canſt in Sin, for God is a conſuming Fire to all ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. And inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Mercy, he will on the contrary Condemn thee, if thou doſt not come unto Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
            <p n="21">21ly, He impedes them, by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:32632:100"/> begeting prejudices in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the faithful Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus; and if he can but do this, he thinks he hath done the work; thus he did in the Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.45. when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had Preached Chriſt and ſo conſequently Salvation to the Gentiles; they then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and Blaſpheme, and are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with envy againſt them. Chriſts Embaſſadors are the very Butt Satan Shoots at, and he knows if he can but keep Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from imbracing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, then he has them ſecure, becauſe Chriſt has committed ſuch treaſure unto them, and his choſen them as inſtruments in an ordinary way to convert Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. and as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.20. <hi>If they have kept my ſayings, they will keep yours alſo.</hi> Satan is not ignorant of this, that the Preaching of the Goſpel is the means of converſion, and the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:32632:100"/> hearing of it, the means of the begeting faith in the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 20.14. Therefore he doth all he can to prevent Sinners, &amp; this he doth ſometimes by ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing of them, and caſting contempt upon them, giving forth names of <hi>Schiſmaticks, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> and the like, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſometimes by blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine they deliver, as though it was not congruent to the word of truth. But Sinner thou haſt no reaſon to believe him, for he is a Lyer, and a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and ſeeks the Blood of thy Soul, and under pretence of keeping thee from deluſion, he deludes thee altogether: For although the World and Devil hate them, perſecute them, and ſpeak evil of them, that is no Argument that they are not therefore Chriſts Miniſters and Servants, but rather that they are ſo, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.30.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Satan hinders, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the Sinner, that Chriſts

Thus Satan renders the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt, as unlovely and intolerable as may be, to the end he may impede the Sinner from coming home to Chriſt, but Satan is not to be credited before Jeſus Chriſt, therefore I ſay hearken to what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. <hi>My Yoke is eaſy, and my Burthen is Light.</hi> All his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and injunctions are light and eaſy, becauſe he puts under everlaſting arms to ſupport the Soul, and inables it to go chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

The experience of all his ſincere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples and ſervants will confute this lying Argument of Satan, for there is not a faithful ſervant of his, but will ſay, they have found his ways pleaſant, and his Burthen tolerable; thou maiſt hear them cry out of the thorn in the Fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8. of the Body of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:32632:107"/> them to come unto him; this is another obſtacle of Satans, by which he impedes many, I fear, of thoſe who go under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtians; for this may be gathered clearly, if we do but view their actions; O how gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily do they fall upon Sin, both Publickly and Privately without any abaſhedneſs or remorſe, which they could never do, if they underſtood and believed that God ſees and obſerves all their ways, <hi>Job.</hi> 34, 21. <hi>For his eyes are upon the ways of Man, and he ſeeth all his goings;</hi> Moreover that he will render according to each ones deeds, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. But whoever thou art, that doſt caſt thine eye upon this Book, and Satan doth ſuggeſt ſuch a thing to thee, as that God doth not reguard the actions of Men here below, ſheild thy ſelf againſt this Dart, by giving credit to the Word of God, <hi>Job.</hi> 31.4. <hi>Doth not God ſee my ways, and count all my Steps?</hi> Prov. 5.2. <hi>For the ways of man are before the eyes of

            <p n="28">28. If that will not do, then <hi>Satan</hi> perſwades the Sinner that he hath no Soul diſtinct from the Body in Nature and Eſſence, but they are the ſame ſubſtance, thus he hath deceived many, with a baſe perſwaſion, that they are no better than the bruits; that their Soul is no other thing then their <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Breath,</hi> or ſome ſuch like thing, and is not of a ſpiritual nature, which can exiſt ſeperate from the Body; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no neceſſity of Chriſt to ſave it; it is not a ſpirit as many fooliſhly conjecture; then what need any care for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it? thus the <hi>Sadduces</hi> of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:32632:108"/> old were deluded by Satan, that Father of Lyes, and Lying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that there are no Angels or Spirits, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. Which made them neglect Chriſt, who came to ſave the Spirits of all them that believe in him; to confute this, and remove this obſtacle out of the way, read <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt</hi> (meaning the Body) <hi>return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return unto God who gave it.</hi> Hear are theſe things obſervable in theſe Words. 1. Here is the Nature of the Soul, it is a Spirit [the Spirit ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God.] 2. The Author and Donator of it, <hi>ſcil.</hi> God: who creating it, infuſed it; and by infuſing it, created it: the Soul is not communicated by the ſeminal vertue, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of both ſexes, as ſome vainly immagin; but it is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit created by God Immediately, and infuſed into, and united to the Body; which unition makes a compleat man.<note place="margin">☜</note> 3. That it doth exiſt diſtinct from the Body, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:32632:109"/> the diſſolution of it, for it returns to him that gave it, even when the Duſty Body, the Houſe of Clay, is mouldred into Earth, which was the <hi>Materia prima,</hi> the firſt matter of it: Now if it were not a diſtinct Imaterial ſubſtance it could never be ſaid to return to God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body, but are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to kill the Soul.</hi> Which words declare, that the Soul and the Body are two diſtinct things, although being united, they conſtitute one man. Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Soul is of a Spiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that can exiſt, ſeperate from the Body, eject and abominate this brutiſh Argument of Satan, who to the end he might bring thy Spirit into the Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with himſelf, ſeeks to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee, thou art no degree higher than a Beaſt, and ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect coming to Chriſt by whom Salvation alone is to be expected.</p>
            <p n="29">29. If they are convinced that the Soul is of a Spiritual Nature, (which no ſerious and rational
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:32632:109"/> Man can deny) then he Labours to perſwade them that it is Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and that when the Body dies, the Soul is annihilate, or at leaſt dies with the Body till the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which is a time moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, if any ſuch thing be. So he perſwades the Sinner to neglect Chriſt, and indulge his Sences; for if the Soul is Mortal, or muſt not appear till the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, it need not be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about a future being, for what man will take care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Manſion, or Build a ſtately Fabrick when there is none to inhabit it? ſo who would buſy their anxious thoughts about Eternity, when they themſelves ſhall be utterly extinct in time? as concerning an immortal State when they are mortal; and ſhall one day totally ceaſe to be? By this falſe Argument, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws many a Soul; and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles them in the Labyrinth of their Luſts, one continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the other, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that the Soul is Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:32632:110"/> but let it not be thy caſe, thus to hearken to the wicked ſuggeſtion of Satan; but believe truth, and the word of God, which evidently manifeſt that the Soul is Immortal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.8. <hi>We are confident I ſay; and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> If the Soul were not Immortal, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would not deſire to be out of the Body, that ſo he being a believer, ſhould be preſent with the Lord. So the Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken to, fully manifeſts the Mortallity of the Soul, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12.7. &amp; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23 To prove this at Large, I leave you to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Wadſworth</hi> concerning the immortallity of the Soul. But if the Soul be (as certainly it is) Immortal, &amp; that by the decree of God it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver die, or utterly ceaſe to be; then that it may live for ever with Chriſt in bliſs and hapineſs, come unto him now he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to invite thee.</p>
            <p n="30">30. And the next Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

I ſhould not have particularized thus, but have contracted and joyned ſome two heads in one; but conſidering that the Tempter is malicious, and ſubtil, and that means by which he doth impede one, he doth not lay to obſtruct another; but conſidering our complection, inclination, and diſpoſition; the place where; the time when; with all the circumſtances and ſtate of our condition, he moſt pollitickly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:32632:112"/> bends the force of his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion accordingly; ſo that if one will not do, he will not fail it poſſible to do by another: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay one he may hold with that Argument that there is no reſurrection of the Dead, and by that means he perſwades him to all licentiouſneſs; and another by this, there will be no future Judgment; therefore thou maiſt take thy fill of Sin, and never look after Chriſt Jeſus, for if there is no Judgment, there is no need of Chriſt. O how many are there in this day of Sin and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, that are impeded by ſome one of theſe Arguments but I beſeech thee let it not be thy caſe; but Read, and beg that thou maiſt believe theſe Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 11.9. and 12:14. And bare upon thy Spirit that of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, ſurgite Mortui, &amp; venite ad Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi> Ariſe ye Dead, and come to Judgment. And alſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, that if thou haſt a Soul
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:32632:113"/> that is immortal, and if there be a God, (which certainly is true) then his Faithfulneſs, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Love and Kindneſs to his People, do ingage and oblige him to make good his Word, fulfil his Promiſes, and execute his Threatenings. Therefore begg grace that thou maiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe all the Darts; diſcover all the baits and devices of Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy Soul, and alſo that thou maiſt come unto Chriſt and accept of him upon the terms of the Goſpel.</p>

               <hi>either this is not the Goſpel of Chriſt, or we are not Chriſtians.</hi> I ſay this has been and is at this day a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Let to poor Sinners, and keeps them from coming to Chriſt. The converſation of ſuch who profeſs Chriſt, ought to be mannaged ſo uprightly, that thereby they might win others unto Chriſt; I know the evil of this by experience, for when I was <hi>Puris Naturalibus,</hi> in my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State and Condition, and obſerving the looſe converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one who ſeemed a great Zealot for Chriſt and pure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; it proved an obſtacle unto me for a time, and kept me back from fully cloſing with the Lord Jeſus. Therefore I only ſay this, Chriſtians look to your
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:32632:115"/> lives, that they be exemplary for holyneſs; and Sinner look to the word of God, which will lead thee unto Chriſt, who is the beſt example and pattern of Piety.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. By their Edicts and ſtrict Laws againſt them, and their threatning of them. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> threatned the Apoſtles, that they ſhould not Preach up Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.17. And thus the <hi>Papists</hi> threaten people with fire and faggot if they come unto Chriſt; their Bloody Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſcares many from believing, profeſſing, and imbracing the truth of the Goſpel; this they have done ever ſince Chriſts time; but let not theſe things deter thee, but conſider the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Apoſtles, when called before the Councel, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto you more then unto God, judg ye.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, By keeping the word of God from them, and not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to read the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:32632:115"/> which are able by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the holy Spirit, to make one wiſe unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> calls them <hi>Animae Pharmaca,</hi> the Medicines of the Soul; there the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may find cure, the blind may receive ſight: the Scriptures are ſuch a copious treaſure, that the Soul may have full ſupplies in time of ſtraits; there it may have councel, as <hi>David</hi> had, they were the men of his councel; there the Soul may come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand its miſery, the way of juſtification and Salvation by a Redeemer; who, and what perſon he is, that he is the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The only begotten Son of God.</hi> In fine, there are all things neceſſary to Salvation; it is like a well ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Magazin, wherein there is plenty of Amunition to offend, and defend againſt the Enemy, and alſo plenty of Proviſion to ſupply the wants of thoſe incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gariſon. But cruel <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> deny them to the Layety,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:32632:116"/> and by that means prevents them from knowing who Chriſt is, and the neceſſity of coming unto him; many have been convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reading the Scriptures, as <hi>Auguſtine, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> with ſeveral others, therefore labour to get the Scriptures, to read and underſtand them, that thou maiſt come unto Chriſt, and that thy Soul may be made eternally happy by him.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly. By perſecuting of, and deſtroying thoſe, who are Chriſts faithful Embaſſadors, that would bring them to Chriſt.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by ſeeing the undanted Spirit of thoſe who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for Chriſt. And many more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I might give.</note> Thus the <hi>Papists</hi> have ſpit out their poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous venome; how many have they made to deny the Lord that bought them! although it muſt be confeſſed that God is pleaſed to order it ſo, that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Martyrum eſt ſemen Eccleſiae,</hi> The Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church, and the more they have been oppreſſed, the more they have Augmented, and by ſcattering have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, as they were in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:32632:116"/> days, yet quite contrary to the deſign of their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as it is ſaid of the great King of <hi>Aſſyria, Iſa.</hi> 10. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to deſtroy Nations, not a few; But God deſigned no ſuch thing, but only to convert and chaſtiſe thoſe who had ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; ſo the wicked perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the World in all the ten bloody perſecutions, and in the <hi>Marian</hi> Days here in <hi>England,</hi> their whole purpoſe and intent was to keep Perſons from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt, and laying hold upon him for Salvation; therefore they deſtroyed the ſhepheards that the Sheep might go aſtray, others through fear of their cruelty be impeded and letted from coming, but that this may not hinder, conſider that to have Chriſt at a dear rate, is better than to have the World at a Cheap; for thou wilt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely be a looſer, if thou haſt the whole world, and yet miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of Chriſt One Chriſt will make thee amends for all thy
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:32632:117"/> ſufferings and afflictions; but ten thouſand Worlds can do thy Soul no good, nor help thee in the evil day, theſe ſufferings are but light and momentary, but the Crown and Glory ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, The things of the World they impede. I ſhall not here particularly treat or make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, becauſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exceeded what I firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; therefore I ſhall only name thoſe three uſual heads, under which all are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Pleaſure, Profit, and Honour, theſe obſtacles are mentioned by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> under the names of the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.16. O how many have theſe worldly terrene vanities prevented from coming unto Chriſt; As</p>
            <p n="1">1. The pleaſures of the world, both lawful and unlawful, as in <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.20. <hi>I have married a Wife and therefore I cannot come.</hi> Here was not ſo much as a civil
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:32632:117"/> excuſe from him, as from the two former, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.19. And why? becauſe he thought ſuch a delightful relation was lawful by divine appointment, and therefore he concluded he might very well anſwer, I cannot come, this man ſuppoſed it more juſt and equal, to ſolace, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate himſelf with the injoyment of a Wife, then to come when the Lords Servants invited; but I fear he is not alone in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for if we paſs by former Ages, and only take a proſpect of the preſent, we ſhall meet with many ſuch anſwers; if not in their Lips, yet in their Lives; it is moſt perſpicuouſly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: but remember this, that comforts are Lawful when Lawfully injoyed; and as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. <hi>All things are Lawful, but all things are not expedient.</hi> For when any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment keeps the Soul from fully cloſing with Chriſt, (though never ſo lawful in it ſelf,) it then becomes ſinful; as

            <p n="2">2. Thoſe pleaſures which are unjuſt, baſe and ſordid; which true vertue and ingenuity never invented, which only gratify the bruitiſh part of man, and have <hi>Plus Alloes, quam Mellis,</hi> more of Gall, then of Hony in them, which do immerge and drown the Sinner in ſenſuallity, nay, may I not ſay in brutiſh beſtiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which make him forget God his Creator, and neglect coming unto Chriſt the only Redeemer and Saviour of Mankind. How many in this Age prefer the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying a baſe Luſt, before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying a glorious Jeſus? their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did pleaſures before the welfare of their immortal Souls; they will do more to pleaſe one ſingle Luſt, though it be to their eternal detriment and loſs; then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light Chriſt and Angels, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:32632:119"/> and turning to him, for there is joy in Heaven at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Sinner. There is no reaſon to be given, why a Sinner ſhould be held by ſuch Cobwebs as theſe: but we ſee by dayly and woful experience, that their Luſt prevails more to keep them from Chriſt; then all the ſweet invitations &amp; promiſes of Chriſt will do to bring them unto him. They will go Twenty Steps af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a vain pleaſure, to damn their Souls, but not one in order to the Salvation of them; it may be when ſome dark Providence beclouds them, when the Night of affliction overſhaddows them, and the Terrors of Conſcience affright them, old decriped Age hath imbicilitated and decayed them, and Death ſtands ready to attend them; then it may be, but not till then, (when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies of this World are imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and have no reliſh) there may be ſome faint deſires after thoſe ſweet Celeſtial Pleaſures, which are at the right hand of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:32632:120"/> God for evermore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. But O Sinner, neglect not Chriſt for a Vanity, a more then Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; let not temporal Pleaſures be prefered before eternal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; what for a momentary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, hazard everlaſting Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; I have before declared what thou ſhalt have if thou comeſt unto Chriſt, weigh them in the Ballance of ſanctified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and try them by the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the Scripture, and then ſee whether Chriſt and his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, be not to be prefered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Profits of the World, are great impediments, when theſe ſtand between Chriſt and the Sinner, and if he comes to Chriſt, he muſt tranſileate and leap over all theſe, he rather chooſes to Sit down contented with his Worldly Portion, and to take the Left hand, rather than the Right hand bleſſings; give him but the Earthly and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial, let who will take the Heavenly and Celeſtial Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

But the benighted Soul being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Dark, as to theſe things, wholly defers coming unto Chriſt. 8. They whoſe minds are Blinded, know not God, who is the fountain of all Good; if they had but a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual underſtanding concerning
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:32632:135"/> God, they would not deſire to be long away from Chriſt; and where there is not this divine knowledg, the Heart cannot be good, <hi>For it is Life eternal to know the only true God, Jo.</hi> 17.3.1. They are ignorant of the infinite ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs and purity of God, <hi>He is of purer Eyes then to behold evil, and he cannot look on Iniquity, Hab.</hi> 1.13. God cannot look on Sin with any approbation; for the leaſt Sin is contrary to his Holyneſs.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:32632:136"/> and that no Sinner or Sinful thing can abide in his preſence, becauſe he is a conſuming Fire to all ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.29.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:32632:136"/> do not believe that he will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every man according to his Deeds, and that God is ſo righteous that he will Puniſh the Leaſt Sin with eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if the Soul be out of Chriſt: but if <hi>God</hi> was not thus impartial, he could not be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; for as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Is God unrighteous who taketh Vengeance?

               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:32632:137"/> will fulfil every one of them; and alſo he is Faithful to make good his Threatnings denounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Sinners, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtrangers to Chriſt, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemys to the Goſpel, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites Sinners to come unto him.

They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not who are the only perſons God loves; conclude they are of that number, who have an intereſt in his Love, not conſidering he loves none but thoſe who believe in, and except of his Son, the Lord Jeſus; all others are objects of his hatred.

            <p n="3">3ly, The third Lett or Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance from within, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of the will, at firſt when <hi>God</hi> created man, he gave unto him a perfect will; and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways willed that which was pleaſing unto <hi>God,</hi> but upon his Sinning he quite depraved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though de did not looſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; now in this depraved ſtate and condition, the Will is perverſe &amp; averſe to that which is truely good; and willeth evil continually; therefore, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have Life.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus who is Life, <hi>Jo.</hi> 11.25. makes offers and tenders of Life unto Sinners, and promiſeth, <hi>If they come he will in no wiſe caſt them out, Jo.</hi> 6.37.

            <p n="4">4ly, The vitioſity and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the affections; is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internal impediment.

We ſhould
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:32632:138"/> take complacency, and delight in him above all; but for the moſt part their joy and delight is in carnal periſhing objects; in the Creature more than in the Creator; for if the Soul took delight in the Father, it muſt needs take complacency in the Son, who is the eternal delight of the Father, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.30. ſo the deſires of the Soul when they ſhould be after <hi>God, Chriſt, Grace,</hi> and eternal <hi>Bleſſedneſs;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.2. <hi>My Soul thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for God, for the living God.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, they are after the World, and the things thereof; they are for who will ſhew us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Good here, as for the Light of Gods Countenance, let thoſe that will ſeek after that: And thoſe paſſions and affections which have evil for their object, are irregular alſo, as Fear, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Hatred, and the like, theſe are placed upon quite contrary objects, the Soul ſhould hate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; ſorrow for Sin, fear the wrath of God, which he hath

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:32632:140"/> loth to own his own poverty and come to Chriſt for Riches; he is unwilling to own his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and come to Chriſt for cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. Becauſe God at firſt made him Lord of the Creature; he concludes he hath now no need of his Creator; he thinks by his own Arme to procure Salvation; and by his own induſtry work out redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for himſelf. To be ſaved by the merits and righteouſneſs of another, he cannot indure to hear of. Man cannot indure to own himſelf a Bankrupt, loſt and undone, unleſs he ſeek to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for help; that he is poor and muſt now turn Beggar, when he has ſo much Riches by him, as he vainly conceits; he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated, and heaped together a little treaſure of fine wiſhes perhaps, with an inconſiderable number of morral or civil acts, and ſo he is an accompliſhed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and it is beneath him to ſeek adjuvation or aſſiſtance from another, for being vainly
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:32632:140"/> puft up in his Fleſhly mind, he ſlights Chriſt; he is like <hi>Eſau,</hi> who having got ſomething of the Riches of the World, ſeems to ſlight <hi>Jacobs</hi> preſents, till he urged him to take them; ſo the Sinner being elevated by the Pride of his Heart, diſeſteems Chriſt, and his tenders of Love and Mercy, till Chriſt do as it were force them upon him, if he at all receive them. Thus have I laboured (as briefly as I could) to lay open many of thoſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments and obſtructions, which deter and impede Sinners from coming unto the Lord Jeſus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is their duty to come, and they are for ever miſerable and undone if they come not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, therefore if any of the forementioned obſtacles ſtand in the way between thee and Chriſt, labour to remove them, and beg grace to overcome them, that thou maiſt come unto the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, I come now to remove a few objections, that ſome may
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:32632:141"/> make againſt this Doctrine, that <hi>It is the duty of all heavy laden Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to come unto Chriſt.</hi> Some may object and ſay, how can this be a duty for all to believe in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and come to Chriſt? this ſuppoſes a will and power in man, or elſe it is to bid a Blind man ſee, a Cripple walk upright, a Child encounter a Gyant, and a Mole overturn a Mountain: if man hath no ability, this can be no duty; I anſwer, 1. Man hath no free will, or power of his own by nature to come, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Not born of Blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh, nor of the will of Man, but of God.</hi> Rom. 5.6. <hi>Whilſt we were yet without ſtrength, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> No ſtrength or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to carry our ſelves to Chriſt, it is God muſt work in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. but although men cannot will or come to Chriſt, yet it is their duty, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent, i. e</hi> Believe in his Son

This is to exalt the Lord Jeſus, in the eſtimation of miſerable Sinners; for being perſwaded of the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this duty, without which they cannot come unto the Father, it will make Chriſt more deſirable, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me, i. e.</hi> By believing in Chriſt Jeſus, that is the only way to be reconciled to <hi>God,</hi> and to obtain mercy from him, <hi>For without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11.6. or be any way grateful to him, for <hi>God</hi> is ſo far from manifeſting his Love to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whilſt they remain ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Chriſt, as that he rather hates them; for God taketh complacency and delight <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> chiefly in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, who is the eternal delight of the Father, and may I ſpeak with reference,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30.</note> (and as I humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume congruent to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:32632:143"/> of Faith) that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes delight or compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in none, neither Angels nor men, except conſidered as elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, becauſe the finite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of the Creature renders it not an adequate object for the delight of an infinite God, or that he ſhould fix his Love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Finite being, when he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and eternal; for God loves not the Creature for it ſelf; for any intrinſick worth or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in it, but for himſelf, and ſo far as he hath ordained it for his glory; there can be no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional felicity unto God; the Creating of the Creature adds nothing to him, neither doth the periſhing of it detract any thing from him; for he hath the ſame fulneſs and perfect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for his delight now, as from all eternity, <hi>ſcil.</hi> his Son Jeſus, in whom he is well pleaſed, <hi>For he is God bleſſed for ever, Rom.</hi> 9.5. So that if we deſire to be belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Father; or to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manifeſtation of it to us, we
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:32632:144"/> muſt go unto Chriſt in a way of Duty, that he may confer and beſtow thoſe graces, (by which we may come unto him,) in a way of Mercy, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Repentance and Faith, for as Chriſt has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Salvation, ſo has he alſo the means by which we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and apply it to our own Souls; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me; and the Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi> By that Faith which Chriſt had purchaſed, and his Spirit had wrought, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did live.</p>
            <p>I come now to the uſes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication that may be made of this Doctrine. 1. Information. 2. Examination. 3. Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It informs us of a great and indiſpenſable duty; for as I have before declared, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of, looking, coming unto, and believing in Chriſt, is a duty relating to all who expect
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:32632:144"/> ſalvation; and are deſirous to be eaſed of their Burthens, which otherwiſe would preſs them down into everlaſting miſery, it is by coming to Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, that the Soul comes to be exonerated and eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all its heavy loads of Sin and guilt; it is a duty and a work that muſt be done, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he hath ſent, ſcil.</hi> His Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. Learn hence the erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falſity of thoſe opinions, that direct the Sinner ſome other way to ſeek for eaſe and help; when it is only to be found in the Lord Jeſus; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your Sins, Jo.</hi> 8.24. There is no other remedy for the wounded Soul, but coming to the Blood of Chriſt; no other Saviour for the loſt Sinner, but the Lord Jeſus; no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for the perſued Malefactor to ſanctuary in, but the name of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:32632:145"/> there is none other that can bare away his burthens of guilt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.22.</note> into the Land of ſeparation, but the Scape-goat, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Lord Jeſus; therefore they do but deceive and delude poor Sinners, who direct them to any other for eaſe or comfort.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, Learn hence that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the right coming unto Chriſt, is not meritorious becauſe it is a Duty. We are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a command of believing in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3 23. now that which is injoyned as a duty to do, cannot be meritorious when done, for the name of Duty doth caſheir and cut off the very Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news and Strength of Merit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.9.10. <hi>When we have done all, we muſt ſay</hi> (not comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentingly) <hi>we are unprofitable Servants; for</hi> (here is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) <hi>we have done but that, which was our duty to do.</hi> It is a duty to come and believe in Chriſt, but our believing doth not merit or deſerve that he ſhould accept of us. Believing in Chriſt is the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:32632:145"/> work of the Spirit of God, it is not by a mans own Power that he imbraceth him.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. Uſe of Examination, to know whether you are come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; and indeed this is the Life of all, for as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examin your ſelves whither you be in the Faith, prove your ſelves; know you not your own ſelves, that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except you he Reprobates?</hi> Here I ſhall propoſe this queſtion, how ſhall I know whether I am come to Chriſt Jeſus or no? I am ſatisfied that it is my Duty to come, and that if I do not come, I am undone and loſt to all eternity. I anſwer, <hi>firſt,</hi> If thou art come unto Chriſt, the Father hath drawn thee, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> Now the Father draws by his election, and ſo gives them unto Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 37.39. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come unto me,</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:32632:146"/> him before the Foundation of the World;</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. God hath elected and made choice of thee, if thou art come to Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting love, therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> Gods Love was fixed from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he manifeſts it in time unto the Soul, in drawing it unto Chriſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given him ſhall come unto him.</hi> God hath choſen them, and given them to his Son, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he draws them to him. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not able to move hand nor foot, <hi>Zyon-ward,</hi> unleſs God draws them, they cannot come unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, If thou art come unto Chriſt, the holy Spirit hath been at work upon thy Soul. 1. To illuminate and inlighten thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. 2. Convince thy Conſcience. 3. Incline thy will. 4. Sanctify thy affections. 5. Work grace in the inward Man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Spirit doth inlighten the underſtanding. By nature
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:32632:146"/> Man is darkneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Therefore he muſt be turned from darkneſs to light, Act.</hi> 26.18. And this is done by the Spirit of God, he opens the Sinners Eyes, that he may know himſelf. <hi>Know thy ſelf deſcended from Heaven;</hi> it is ſaid concerning the Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17. When he came to himſelf, then he thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home to his Father, not before; ſo it muſt be with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sinner, he muſt come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to know what he is before he will come to Chriſt, if thou art come to the Lord Jeſus, thou haſt been made to ſee thy miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and deplorable condition by nature, that thou art a Child of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. ſubject and obnoctious to the wrath of God, deſerveſt nothing but wrath, and it were juſtice in God to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wrath upon thee, even for thy natural pollution and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much more for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted filth and impurity in thy converſation; that thou art loſt and ſhalt periſh for ever
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:32632:147"/> without a Redeemer, a Jeſus, to ſave thee; that thou art an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>God, Rom.</hi> 5.10. and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reconciliation with him through the Blood of Chriſt; that thou art unregenerate, and without regeneration, no ſeeing the Kingdom of <hi>God, Jo.</hi> 3.3. miſerable all over, nothing but Wounds, and Bruiſes, and Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sores; miſerable becauſe in thy fleſh <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18.</note> dwelleth no good thing, Sin Raigning, Satan Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating at his will, the World allureing and perſwading, and thou art without ſtrength or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to reſiſt and overcome theſe, and many more I might number up, are the evils which in <hi>Puris naturalibus,</hi> in thy Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition, make it deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therefore the holy Spirit brings thee firſt to know thy ſelf, before thou comeſt unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, To know and underſtand the Scriptures is another effect of the Spirit upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thoſe, who are come to, and have cloſed with the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:32632:147"/> Lord Jeſus. As it is ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.45. <hi>He opened their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings that they might underſtand the Scriptures.</hi> Therein all things concerning Chriſt are revealed, <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures for in them ye think to have eternal Life, (i. e.</hi> the knowledge of eternal Life) <hi>and they are they which teſtify of me.</hi> Now the Spirit doth open the Eye of the underſtanding, that it may in the glaſs of the Scriptures, ſee thoſe things clearly, which are neceſſary to Salvation, to wit, repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God,</hi> and faith towards our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.21. it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the mind and will of <hi>God</hi> fully, and directs poor Sinners, who are ſtung in the Wilderneſs to look up to the BrazenSerpent, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.14. it declares that <hi>there is Salvation in none other.</hi> I do not here ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.</note> that the Spirit teaches all to read the Scriptures, who are adult, and grown into a capacity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing their Reaſon, for there are many, who I am perſwaded,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:32632:148"/> have cloſed with Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and others, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſm and Gentiliſm by being brought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> that could not read the Scriptures; but this I aſſert, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is inlightened by the Spirit to diſcern the things of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when preached or read to them out of the holy Scriptures; for without a right underſtanding of the Scriptures, there can be no apprehending the right way of Salvation. All the Phyloſophers of old, with all their profound Learning, Arts, &amp; Sciences, did not know Chriſt, &amp; ſo conſequently they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the way of Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is the only way.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, Thou art brought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and know thy duty in a great meaſure, thy duty towards <hi>God,</hi> thy duty towards thy <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and thy duty towards thy ſelf. 1. Towards <hi>God,</hi> that thou oughteſt to Love him for himſelf, to Love him as thy Creator, and as a bountiful Benefactor to thee; to Love him primarily, ſuperlatively, and above all: as the Text ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:32632:148"/> Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength, Deut.</hi> 6.5. To love him fervently and permanently: if thou art not come to Chriſt, beſure there is none of this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love in thee, for as God loves not the Sinner but as cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. ſo the Sinner can never love God as he ought, but in and through Chriſt; and as God ſees no love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs in the Sinner, conſidered out of Chriſt; ſo the Sinner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no amiableneneſs in God, but in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt; for God is a conſuming fire to Sinners if they be ſeperate from Chriſt; ſo that I ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. ult.</note> thou art taught to love God as an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good. 2. To fear him, not with a <hi>Bondage, Slaviſh fear, Rom.</hi> 8.15. but with a <hi>Filial and Holy fear,</hi> ſuch a fear as becometh Gods Children, a reverential fear, a fearing to diſpleaſe him, ſuch a fear Chriſt Jeſus had in his humiliation ſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.8. and ſuch a fear have all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:32632:149"/> who are come unto him, and are implanted in him. 3. Taught to ſerve him, before thou waſt the Servant of Sin and Satan, but now the Servant of the living God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. now thou deſireſt, and indeavoureſt to obey him conſtantly, as to the time, fervently &amp; faithfully, as to the manner; and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, as to the Practice of them, in all holy dutys, as it was ſaid of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, They walked in all the Commandments of God, Luk.</hi> 1.6. So it is thy care and Study to obey him in all things he requires from thee. 4. Thou art taught to glorify God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief end of thy Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>For he hath made all things for himſelf, Pſal.</hi> 16.4. Thou indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureſt to glorify thy Soul and Body which are his, according to that command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Glorify God in your Bodys and in your Spirits which are Gods.</hi> Thus Chriſt Jeſus did, as he ſaith, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth;</hi> ſo he ſaith of his Diſciples, <hi>Jo</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:32632:149"/> 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ye bare much Fruit, ſo ſhal ye be my Diſciples.</hi> Thus thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf that thou art come to Chriſt, and to be one of his Diſciples, if thou indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſt to glorifie God. 2. Thou art inlightened to know thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards thy Neighbour, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is the ſecond great Commandment, to love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, Mat.</hi> 22.39. 1. To love his Perſon, as he is the workmanſhip of God, fearfully and wounderfully made, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14. Thou art to love him, not to envy him, <hi>Let not thy Heart envy Sinners, but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long,</hi> Saith the wiſe man, thou maiſt hate the Sins of thy wicked Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, becauſe they are againſt God and his own Soul; but thou art to Love his Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may be converted, and ſhine gloriouſly for ever; you may be Heirs together of the ſame happineſs. 2. And princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, to deſire and indeavour
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:32632:150"/> the good of his Soul; by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable reproof for Sin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17.<note place="margin">

            <p n="4">4ly, Thou art brought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Law, not only the Letter of it, but the ſpirituallity, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. not only as it relates to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:32632:151"/> the Soul, even in the very thoughts of evil, the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acts and communicates it to the underſtanding; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the will, the will to the affections. Thus there is a ſecret paſſage of every thought of evil, throughout the whole Soul: therefore the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>The imaginations and thoughts of Mans Heart, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil continually.</hi> Now the natural unconverted man, diſcerns not this heart-evil or the ſpiritualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law but he that is come to Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was, to cloſe with him, and believe in him, he perceives it. 2. Thou ſeeſt the purity and holyneſs of it, as well as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallity of it. The Law of God is pure and holy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.8. the Commandment of the Lord is pure, inlightening the Eyes; it is holy in that it comes from a holy God, and tends to make and keep men holy; holy in its nature; and the inlightened Soul perceives and diſcerns an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

Thus when the Eyes are open to diſcern theſe things of the Law, it becomes a School-Maſter to bring the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Chriſt that he may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith in him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Divines ſay, the Law ſhould be Preached before the <hi>Goſpel, John</hi> Baptiſt-like, to be a Harbinger to prepare the way for Chriſt into the Soul, that he may find free and ready enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. 4.

There are theſe ſeveral things which the Spirit teacheth the Soul concerning God the Father,

The underſtanding is made to apprehend the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infinite purity of <hi>God, Heb.</hi> 1.13. <hi>God</hi> is of purer Eyes then to behold iniquity, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:32632:156"/> he cannot be polluted with Sin; which the natural Man doth not apprehend.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, The righteouſneſs of God; the perſon that is come to Chriſt apprehends God to be a juſt and righteous, God; for his righteouſneſs is ſeen in the death of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. <hi>To declare his righteouſneſs;</hi> the righteouſneſs of God was manifeſtly declared, in that he ſpared not his own Son, although he was only a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Sin was only imputed to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 21. <hi>He was made Sin for us, i. e.</hi> he ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due unto us for our Sins; <hi>yet he knew no Sin, that we might become the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> God is a righteous and juſt God in all his works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17. This was one thing Chriſt ſaid the Spirit ſhould do, when he came from the Father, <hi>He ſhould convince of righteouſneſs, Jo.</hi> 16.8. of the righteouſneſs of God, as well as the want of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in themſelves. I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly queſtion whither a perſon be
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:32632:156"/> come to Chriſt, if he is not in ſome meaſure acquainted with the righteouſneſs of God; my reaſon is this, till the Eye of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be opened, ſo as to ſee the righteouſneſs of God, that he renders to every Man according to his deeds; that he requires compleat obedience, and will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the uttermoſt Farthing, that he will not paſs by the leaſt Sin without full ſatisfaction to his juſtice; or elſe in equity he will puniſh every Sinner with infinite puniſhment; till then I ſay, the Soul doth not ſo much regard coming to Chriſt, that it may be made partaker of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when the Sinner is made to ſee Gods righteouſneſs, then he flys to the Horns of the Alter, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to lay hold of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, tendered to Poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="6">6ly, I might add further that the Spirit doth inlighten the underſtanding to diſcern the Love, Pity, and mercy of God in Chriſt, and his readineſs and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:32632:157"/> willingneſs to accept of thoſe who come unto him, in and through his Son, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting Life; God is ready to give and be reconciled, Pſal.</hi> 86.5. But there is no coming unto him but by Chriſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.6. theſe conſiderations do incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Poor Soul to come to Chriſt, becauſe God is full of Pitty, and faithfulneſs to forgive. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p n="7">7ly, The Spirit inlightens the mind in the knowledg of Chriſt, 1. What he is. 2 What he hath done. 3. What he is doing in the behalf of Poor Sinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What he is, I have declared in the beginning of this Book, <hi>that he is God bleſſed for ever, Rom.</hi> 9.5. the true God and eternal life, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.20. that he is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal delight of the Father, the Glory of Angels, admired by Saints; and the Saviour of poor loſt Sinners; that he is God-man
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:32632:157"/> in two diſtinct natures, and one perſon, for ever: as he was Man, he ſuffered; but as he was God-Man, he ſatisfied infinite Juſtice, by laying down an infinite price for infinite tranſgreſſions: It was the blood of him that was God, as well as Man, that was effuſed and poured forth for our ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, What he hath done for loſt ſinners? he who was in the form of God, took upon him the form of a Servant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. he put himſelf into a capacity to fulfil all righteouſneſs, and to undergo all miſery for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, that he might ſave us from the wrath of God, wch will conſume all thoſe who believe not in Chriſt: he hath compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work of Redemption, for <hi>we are made compleat in him, Col.</hi> 2.10. In ſhort, he hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the whole Law in way of obedience; he ſuffered the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty due unto thoſe whom he redeemed; <hi>he was made a Curſe for them, Gal.</hi> 3.13. that they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:32632:158"/> might obtain the bleſſing, even life for evermore; he died that they might live, for by dying he conquered Death, and brought life and immortality to light: he broke through the Priſon of the grave, and by his own power brought Salvation, and <hi>aſcended on high, and lead captivity captive, that he might give gifts unto men, Eph.</hi> 4.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is now ſitting at the right hand of God till his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be made his foot-ſtool, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. and his Saints crowned and glorified with him in his Kingdom; he prayed for them when he was here on earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. but now he is interced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the right hand of God in the behalf of his redeemed ones, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1.

Thou art now convinced that Sin is exceeding ſinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 17.13. and that thy great work and buſineſs in thy unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate was to Sin againſt God.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, Thou art convinced that every Sin doth contaminate and defile thy Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret Sins.</hi> Which Petition implys that Sin (though never ſo ſecret) defiles the Soul; moreover the holy Prophet hath not only regard (in the word ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) to thoſe Sins which the Eye of man had not ſeen; but to thoſe Sins which were ſecret to himſelf, which in thought, Word, or deed, he had perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, and yet not obſerved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.2. <hi>Waſh me throughly from my iniquity, and cleanſe me from my Sin.</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>Purge me with hyſop, and I ſhall be clean, waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter then Snow.</hi> Which Scripture doth evince that Sin doth defile, and therefore the

When he had a viſion of the Lord Jeſus, and was nigh unto him, then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims that he is unclean: ſo it is with thee if thou art come to Chriſt; thou art convinced that Sin hath polluted and defiled thee, the conviction of which drives thee to that Fountain <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood of Chriſt laid open for Sin, and for uncleanneſs,<note place="margin">Every Sin commited is againſt the bleſſed Trinity, and the goodneſs, love, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Patience of God.</note> 
               <hi>Zach.</hi> 13, 1.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, Thou art convinced that Sin is againſt <hi>God, Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I Sinned, and done evil in thy ſight.</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this, is that of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.18. <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and ſay unto him,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:32632:161"/> Father, I have Sinned againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and before thee.</hi> Thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that every Sin is againſt the Eſſence and Being of <hi>God;</hi> contrary to his nature, and to his revealed will; I leave thee to inlarge upon this in thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meditation.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, Thou art convinced of the dangerous conſequences and effects of Sin if perſiſted in; for then there is nothing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected but wrath, confuſion, and eternal deſtruction; where <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum culpae,</hi> the Evil of guilt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds and goes before; <hi>Malum penae</hi> the Evil of puniſhment fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after.

            <p n="6">6ly, Thou art convinced of Righteouſneſs, as <hi>Jo.</hi> 16.8. <hi>When be it come, he ſhall convince the World of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that a righteouſneſs thou needeſt, &amp; a righteouſneſs thou muſt have; both internal, which is wrought by the Spirit, and external, which is wrought by Chriſt; <hi>God</hi> is a righteous <hi>God,</hi> and his Law is righteous, and there is no ſtanding the tryal without a compleat and perfect righteouſneſs, the Law will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no repentance as the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth, it requires full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in point of ſuffering, or compleat and perfect perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance in point of doing; if the offence be but one, and againſt one clauſe of the Law, there is a breach of the whole, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. and how ſhall the poor Sinner
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:32632:162"/> do now who hath broken all? the Spirit convinces the Sinner of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is apprehended by faith, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables the Sinner to lay hold of it; and to ſay, <hi>Chriſt was made Sin for me, who knew no Sin, that I might become the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Paul</hi> was thus convinced, when he ſaid, <hi>I would not be found in my own righteouſneſs, but in the righteouſneſs of God which is by Faith in Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. Thou art convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a perfect righteouſneſs if thou art truely come unto, and haſt cloſed with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7ly, and Laſtly, thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Judgment, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16.8. he convinces of Judgment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for Men once to dye, and after death comes judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> a particular, as well as a univerſal, and it ſhall be a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sinner who is impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Thou treaſureſt up wrath, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of wrath, and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous judgment of God;</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:32632:162"/> now being convinced of this, thou expecteſt &amp; prepareſt day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it, becauſe it is the day in which thou ſhalt be acquitted; but the enemys of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>For there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus, Rom</hi> 8 1 But there is no ſtanding forth ungodly in Judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5. That which is the ground of terror to the wicked, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the day of judgment is a ground of comfort and conſolation to the righteous; the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth exhort the afflicted Brethren to be patient, upon this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the coming of the Lord was at hand, &amp; the Judge ſtandeth before the Door, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7.8, 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, If thou art come to the Lord Jeſus, then the holy Spirit hath inclined thy will and made it flexible, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>They ſhall be a willing People in the day of thy Power, Cantic.</hi> 6.12. The Margent of ſome Bibles read it thus, <hi>My Soul, ſet me on the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots of my willing People.</hi> It is true that the will remains ſtill in

Now I ſay, the Spirit hath not drawn compulſively; but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly lead thee unto the Lord Jeſus, of unwilling by nature he hath made thee abundantly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, through the Work of grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou art made willing to part with thy Sins; to ſhake hands with them, and bid adieu to all thy former vanitys, which by nature thou art Prone to; there is a purging out of the old leaven, <hi>For the Temple of God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17.

            <p n="2">2ly, Thou art made willing by the holy Spirit to renounce
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:32632:163"/> thy own ragged and imperfect righteouſneſs; for as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, this keeps back many from coming fully to the Lord Jeſus; but there muſt not only be Sin caſt away, but ſelf-righteouſneſs alſo; for it is the ruin of many, and hath been ſo, that they relye more upon their <hi>own</hi> righteouſneſs, then on <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſneſs; the <hi>Jews</hi> loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. but if thou art come to Chriſt, thou willingly ſay'ſt with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>And be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> Thou lookeſt upon thy own, as indeed it is, imperfect and inſufficient in point of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it muſt by no meanes ſtand in competition with Chriſt and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, Thou art made willing to accept and imbrace a whole Chriſt upon Goſpel Termes;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:32632:164"/> Chriſt on the Throne as well as at the Altar; Chriſt in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office, to rule and govern thee, to impoſe Laws and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which thou muſt obey; as well as Chriſt a Prieſt to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice himſelf, that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Wrath of God, ſatisfie his divine juſtice, extinguiſh thoſe flames with his Blood, which ſin had incendiated, &amp; that he might procure Salvation for poor Sinners: Chriſt in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick office, to teach and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Fathers will to thee, for no man can know the Father or his will as he ought, but he to whom the Son will reveal them by his holy Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Neither knoweth any man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. <hi>The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> I ſay thou art willing to receive a whole Chriſt, as the Goſpel tenders and offers him to poor Sinners, to be Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and Redemption,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:32632:164"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Chriſt will either be a whole Saviour, or none; he will raign in the heart alone, or not at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Thou art willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Lord Jeſus in all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitutions and commands and not ſay as thoſe Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.60. <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> thou doſt not look upon his commands as grievous, for <hi>his Yoak is eaſie, and his Burthen is light,</hi> Mat. 11.30. <hi>To will is preſent with thee, although how to perform thou knoweſt not, Rom.</hi> 7, 18.

               <hi>Fifthly and laſtly,</hi> Thou art wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny thy ſelf, and follow Chriſt to the end, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Mountains of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that may oppoſe thee in thy Chriſtian courſe, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14, 26. <hi>If any man come unto me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple;</hi> Verſe 27. <hi>And whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs and come after me, cannot be my
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:32632:166"/> Diſciple.</hi> Self-denial is a ſpecial leſſon to be learned in the ſchool of Chriſt; he was frequently (when he was upon earth) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing his Diſciples in this kind of Literature. Chriſts Croſs is to be learned even in the A B C of Chriſtianity; and Chriſtians are daily to exerciſe themſelves in the ſtudy of it, that they may be good Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had made a fair Progreſs, and was got to the higheſt Forme in Chriſts School, when he could ſay, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world, Gal.</hi> 6.14. This was a brave ſpirit in him, that he could glory and boaſt of his afflictions and ſufferings for the Lord Jeſus. Enemies and afflictions muſt be expected in the narrow way which leads to life, and thoſe who follow the Lord Jeſus to the end, will be followed by Satan and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet for all theſe things
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:32632:167"/> the Spirit maketh the Soul wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to keep cloſe to the Lord Jeſus; and once having choſen him, never finally to foraſake him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, The Spirit doth ſanctify and regulate the affections, which in the unregenerate ſtate are totally vitiated; in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſtate the heart loves ſin more than holineſs; the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Creature, more than the eternal Creator; it can delight in earthly carnal vanities, but takes no complacency in the ways or things of God and Chriſt; it can ſorrow and lament for worldly ſufferings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, but hath no grief at all for ſin, and tranſgreſſion of the holy Law of God, and that affront upon the glorious Majeſty of Heaven; the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Mind fears more the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of mortal Man, whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the great God, who lives for ever; but now the work of the Spirit is to purify and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:32632:167"/> theſe affections and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Soul, and fix them upon more ſuitable and God-pleaſing objects; and this he hath affected upon thy Soul if thou art brought home to the Lord Jeſus. Now thou canſt ſay with <hi>David, O how I love thy Law; it is my Meditation all the day long,</hi> Pſal. 119.97. <hi>The Law of thy Mouth is better to me than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Gold or Silver,</hi> ver. 72. The Soul hath a high eſtimation of, and valuation for the Law of God; it eſteems of God as the ſupream good, becauſe he is an all ſufficient, eternal, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable good; he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which never ceaſeth flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Sea not to be exhauſted, a Tree which always bears fruit; therefore the Soul makes choice of him, and highly magnifies him; Chriſt is now an object thy heart doth moſt delight in, and thou lookeſt upon all other things, but as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Dogs-meat in compariſon of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowledge of Chriſt
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:32632:168"/> Jeſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. Thou canſt ſay of Chriſt as the Philoſopher lid of Vertue, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is no poſſeſſion more glorious and ſplendid, more firm and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; now thy heart hates and abhors that evil which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou lovedſt; and thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt that good, which formerly thy mind was a verſe to.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly <hi>and laſtly,</hi> If thou art come unto the Lord Jeſus, then the holy Spirit hath wrought all theſe graces within thy Soul, which do manifeſt thee to be a real and ſound Chriſtian. I ſhall only treat of theſe ſix, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Faith, Love, Hope, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Zeal; where theſe are wanting in the heart, Chriſt is not poſſeſſor there; but where theſe are effectually wrought, be ſure the Soul hath cloſed with him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then I ſay, thou art brought to Repentance, this was the Doctrine <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Repent ye, for the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:32632:168"/> Kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> Chriſt preached it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.35. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall likewiſe periſh.</hi> The Apoſtle Paul preached up this Truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and 21. <hi>Repentance towards God;</hi> That they ſhould repent and turn to God, and do works meet for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. So that we ſee here is an abſolute neceſſity of this grace being wrought in the Soul. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of a Repentance unto life, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. <hi>Then hath God granted unto the Gentiles Repentance unto life.</hi> Here I ſuppoſe thou mayſt be ready to propoſe this Query, how may I know whether my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be unto life or no? I anſwer, there is a twofold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Evangelical:</hi> I ſhall paſs by the firſt, and only ſpeak to the laſt, being that which reſolves the Query, an <hi>Evangellic Repentance,</hi> may be known theſe three ways, 1. by the <hi>Objects</hi> of it. 2. by its <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Propertys.</hi> 3. by the ſeveral <hi>effects</hi> of it. When I have declared
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:32632:169"/> theſe things in particular, thou mayſt reſolve thy ſelf whether <hi>this grace</hi> be wrought in thy Soul by the holy Spirit or no.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Evangellic Repentance may be known by its objects: by <hi>Objects,</hi> I mean thoſe things the Soul eyes and looks upon when it is moved thus to repent; and they are theſe five 1. ſin. 2. the Law. 3. God. 4. Chriſt. 5. Goſpel. 1. ſin; both original and actual, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> 1 and 2 ver. <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my tranſgreſſions. Waſh me throughly from mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and cleans me from my ſin,</hi> 3 ver. <hi>My ſin is ever before me.</hi> How often doth the Prophet mention his ſin. This cut and wounded his Soul, that he had ſinned, the Soul looks upon ſin both exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, &amp; internally; ſecret, as well as publick, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. It looks upon ſin, as ſin: Therefore Mourns over it with a Godly ſorrow. Sin is ſuch a vile thing

               </note> that the Heathen Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher could ſay, we ought to be perſwaded (if we have made any proficiency in Phyloſophy) if we could be ſecret or hid from all Gods and Men, yet to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing avaritiouſly, nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, nothing luſtfully, nothing incontinently; but the true goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Penitent looks upon it as the worſt of evils, the Soul pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting evil, Soul deforming, and Soul damning evil, it cannot look upon Sin with a pleaſant aſpect, when grace is truely active the Soul cannot behold Sin, without a ſigh in the Heart or tear in the Eye, <hi>Wo unto us that we have Sinned,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.16. All who have been brought home to Chriſt, have come by weeping Croſs; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and bewailing their Sin; they have looked upon Sin as the heavieſt burden, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 384 and the bittereſt Pill that ever they took.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, The next object is the Law, when the Soul looks upon
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:32632:170"/> the holyneſs, juſtneſs, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law; it cannot but mourn becauſe it hath violated and tranſgreſſed it. <hi>Every Sin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.4. We find it thus with the Servants of God, in their confeſſion and humiliation for Sin; when they repented, they had an Eye to the Law, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.10. <hi>And now O Lord what ſhall we ſay after this; for we have departed from thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Dan. 9.5. <hi>We have Sinned and committed Iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by departing from thy Precepts, and thy judgments.</hi> Thus we ſee they had an Eye to the Law of God which was broken by them; and it was the trouble and grief of their Souls, and ſo it hath been with thee, if thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is true.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, The Soul hath an Eye to God. When it conſiders God to be an infinite good, and yet he hath been ſlighted; a gracious God, yet he hath been offended; a loving and merciful Father,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:32632:170"/> yet he hath been abuſed; a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, and yet he hath been diſhonoured; this melts the Soul into tears, becauſe it hath thus requited the Lord for all his mercys; what ſaith the Soul? hath he given me my being, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. and 20.21. and that for this end, that I ſhould glorify him, love, fear, and ſerve him, and that to the uttermoſt, both with my Soul and Body? &amp; have I wicked wretch, diſhonour'd him, ſinned againſt him from the very womb? I went aſtray, followed the curſed immaginations of my own baſe heart, my ears were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the whiſperings, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of Satan, that enemy to my Soul; but they were ſhut, and deaf to the calls of God, my Creator, from whom I receive my All, and to whom I owe all that I am or can be; all the members of my Body, and all the faculties of my Soul, ſhould have been imployed in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will, but I, vile wretch that I am, have neglected,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:32632:171"/> diſeſteemed, and offended my gracious God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. Try if this has been the language of thy Soul, I have Sinned againſt my God, and therefore I mourn; and <hi>Oh that my head was a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4ly, True repentance hath Chriſt for its object, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>And I will pour upon the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the Spirit of grace and of ſupplication, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have peirced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only Son; and ſhall be in Bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his Firſt born.</hi> Here we ſee a prophecy of Chriſt, to be fulfilled in the latter days, doth clearly confirm this truth. And thus it is with every Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-penitent, who comes unto Chriſt; he looks upon the wounds of Chriſt by the Eye of Faith, the Eye affects the Heart, and makes the Sinner mourn and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:32632:171"/> lament that he ſhould be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Sins, and bruiſed for his Iniquitys; that the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his peace ſhould be upon him; and that by his Stripes he ſhould be healed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. O how doth the conſideration of this wound the poor Soul, and makes it kindly mourn over all thoſe Sins and tranſgreſſions, which wounded and peirced the Lord Jeſus.

O the heinouſneſs of my Sins that no meaner Perſon could ſuffer for them: Again, it looks upon the ſufferings themſelves, they were Torments, Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Bruiſes, and Stripes; the inflictions were infinite, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for infinite Tranſgreſſions; he was wounded in his Body by wicked Men, and he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Soul from his Father, which was the Soul of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. <hi>My Soul is

            </p>
            <p>There are theſe four things implyed in our departing from Iniquity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A turning from it, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of it; a bidding adieu to all and every ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>To turn them from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Acts 3.26 <hi>God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning every one of you away from his Iniquity,</hi> Iſa. 55.7. <hi>Let the

            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly <hi>and laſtly,</hi> The abſeſſion or departing from Iniquity, is
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:32632:177"/> to go the quite contrary way, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the way of righteouſneſs and holineſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Flee youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts, but follow Righteouſneſs, Faith, Charity, Peace, with them that call on the Lord with a pure heart.</hi> As there is the departing from the one, there is a walking in the other; it is not enough to ceaſe to do evil, but there muſt be a learning to do well, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.17.

            <p n="3">3dly, The next property of Evangelic Repentance, is with the whole heart, to turn to the Lord; and this is called the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> the Term to which every true penitent does turn; there were ſome we read of who returned, but not to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:32632:178"/> God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.16. <hi>They returned, but not to the moſt high:</hi> It may be they turned from the groſs and notorious ſins, to private, and ſeemingly leſſer ſins; the Prodigal turns covetous, and the openly prophane become ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hypocrites; but this is no repentance, for there muſt be a total turning to the Almighty, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.1. <hi>If thou wilt return, O Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, return unto me;</hi> to me, and to none other; for elſe it is but a mocking of God, and cheating our own ſelves; to reſt any where ſhort of God, is not real Repentance; for it is the nature of it (when wrought by the Spirit) to lead the Soul home to God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the Man of Iniquity his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will multiply to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> There muſt be a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God the Lord, for he is the Center of the Souls happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: as the needle once touch'd

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:32632:179"/> fruit in due ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. If the ground brings forth nothing but Briers and Thorns, it is near unto curſing; if ſin doth ſtill predominate over the Soul, and it is lead captive by luſts, and enormities, then it is far from bleſſing, or partaking of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangellic grace of Repentance; for where it is wrought by the Spirit of God, it doth certainly bring forth fruit, in ſome thirty, in ſome ſixty, and in ſome a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold, to the eternal glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of that God, <hi>who works all our works in us, and for us,</hi> Iſa. 26.12. The property of true Repentance is not only to drop a tear for ſin, or to lament a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, whilſt the Soul is under ſome apprehenſions of future Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then in a ſhort time to turn again to folly; but it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately buds and brings forth fruit, and ſo continues to the end. Now humility grows on the ſame Tree which before was heavy laden with Pride; now there is Love, Meekneſs, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:32632:179"/> exerting and puting forth their ſeveral fruits, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly there was nothing but Envy, Hatred, Impatiency,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</note> and Uncharitableneſs: Now the Soul doth not only hate, fear, and forſake ſin; but it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in bringing forth fruit of obedience to all the known Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God, and Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.14. <hi>It departs from ſin, and doeth good, and it ſeeks peace,</hi> all the ways that tends to peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, This Repentance may be known by the effects of it in the ſoul; it hath various influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>conſcience.</hi> 1.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:32632:180"/> could have no Love or likeing for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.4. ſaith the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophet, <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> and verſ. 113. <hi>I hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I Love.</hi> This good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had ſometime been tutored in the School of repentance, and had learned the Leſſon of the Rod, by which he was Laſhed for his tranſgreſſions; he felt the ſmart of it, and Learned the cauſe, which was Sin and Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore now he abhors and deteſts every vain way; therefore you may make tryal by this, whether your repentance hath been true; for as it is in nature, we are apt to hate thoſe things we are ſenſible have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced or pained us, ſo the Soul cannot but hate Sin, which it now finds and is ſenſible that it is wronged by it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.26.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, A timidity and fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of falling into Sin any more, or to be inſnared by the devices of Satan. This effect Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance had upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>For

            <p n="4">4ly, Fixed reſoluſions and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with God, to keep his Law in violably, as far forth as the Soul is aſſiſted by the bleſſed ſpirit. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, I have ſworn, and I will perform it,<note place="margin">

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:32632:181"/> of their Souls, and in the 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> They are covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us make a covenant with our God.</hi> They were ready to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, to put away all their abominations, and to keep his righteous judgments. The like we find in the 9. of <hi>Nehem.</hi> They had kept a ſollemn Faſt, and the Levites confeſſed Gods goodneſs, and their wickedneſs in departing from the Living God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. <hi>And becauſe of this we make a ſure covenant, and write it, and our Princes, Levites, and Prieſts Seal unto it.</hi> What effect this true Godly ſorrow had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in general, where it is right, it hath the ſame upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in particular: the Soul that hath ſmarted by Sin, and ſincerely lamented over it, and repented for it, O what reſolves! what ingagements! what ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſes doth it make; that it will not live in Sin, but will walk in the paths of Gods commandments, and keep his
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:32632:182"/> precepts to the end. This is the reſolved purpoſe, (I ſay) of every individual perſon that hath evangelically repented of his tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, Another effect is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Love to, and ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after holyneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. what vehement deſire (ſaith the Apoſtle) hath this Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wrought in you? a deſire after holyneſs, after more grace, the Soul pants after it, becauſe it loves it; there is <hi>Sacra fames non auri, ſed ſanctimoniae,</hi> a greedy and a vehement appetite, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gold, but after Grace and Sanctity;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11.</note> now it clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that holyneſs is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing, a beam of the Son of Righteouſneſs, a Ray of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Finger-work of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, the very Image of the Eternal being, the nature and eſſence of the glorious Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, the meet quallification of thoſe who expect a fruition of the beatificial viſion. Where this hath gotten poſſeſſion, there is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:32632:182"/> peace, exhaltation, &amp; tryumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God, and Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul loves it with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and fixed Love; ſhee greatly Loves it, and alſo the means that tend to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo great and glorious a good. The Soul Loves the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit becauſe he is the efficient; the word of God which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly, and Laſtly, Peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by the application of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, now there is a ſweet and pleaſant calmneſs in the Soul; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual preturbations; one wave toſſing and rolling upon the neck of another, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Trouble and vexation of Spirit. Where Luſts domineer, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prevail, there is nothing but perpetual Commotions and diſtractions; but when this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ejected and caſt out, and the Soul hath bathed it ſelf in the tears of Repentance, and is made pure by the Blood of the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:32632:183"/> Lord Jeſus; O then what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſedateneſs, and tranquility is there. Sin (whilſt a Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in an impenitent State and condition,) like a Mad-man rageth in the Soul; but when Chriſt brings the Soul to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the weeping-croſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he then ſaith to it, as he did to the Sea, <hi>Peace, be ſtill;</hi> or as he did to his Diſciples, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Let not your Hearts be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi> and Verſ. 27. <hi>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the World giveth, give I unto you, let not your Hearts be troubled.</hi> The Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>is a Goſpel of peace, Rom.</hi> 10.15. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.15. Becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth Peace, and ſpeaks peace from God and Chriſt unto poor wounded and diſtreſſed Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; the Blood of Chriſt is the only ſanctifying Medicine, which the Goſpel holds forth to cure wounded conſciences. Thus I have finiſhed the firſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>I come now to the ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:32632:183"/> grace, by which a perſon may know that he is come to Chriſt; and it is this, the Spirit hath wrought the grace of Faith in the Soul; for it is by Faith the Soul apprehends and lays hold upon the Lord Jeſus. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there are four kinds of Faith, yet there is but one true Evangelick and ſaving Faith; and my buſineſs muſt be to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you how you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern this from the others, which will never end in ſalvation, and I ſhall do it with as much brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as may be, for the diſcuſſing ſo great a queſtion as this is, how may I know that I have ſaving Faith? I anſwer, it may be known theſe four ways. 1. By the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or Efficient. 2. By the Objects. 3. By the Nature of it. and 4. By the effects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Author, and he is the Spirit of God; for no Man can work Faith in his own Heart, or can believe by his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is a ſupernatural and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine work, <hi>Faith is the gift of God,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:32632:184"/> Eph.</hi> 2.8. It is the work of the Spirit of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit, are Love, Peace, Joy, Goodneſs, Faith.</hi> If the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, hath not been at work upon thy Soul; never conceit thy ſelf to have any Grace, we find this work once attributed to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith; but this muſt be underſtood,<note place="margin">Agit filius per ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum. <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin.</hi>
               </note> * that Chriſt doth it by his holy Spirit, and the Spirit works powerfully and with the irreſiſtable efficacy; he makes the Soul believe thoſe things now, which all Men or Angels could never have done, if they had Preached Millions of years: it now believes unſeen things, an unſeen Jeſus, and an inviſſible glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. If you have no more Faith then what your own reaſon or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment helps you to, or the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men hath principled you with, do not conclude it to be ſaving, but Sinful; the Spirit is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:32632:184"/> the Efficiently, and works inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally by the word of God, by which he brings the Soul to believe in, and cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, It is known by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it. 1. The Word of God; that is an object of true Faith; the Soul is brought to believe the verity and certainty of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it believes not becauſe Man ſaith, ſo and ſo you muſt believe, but becauſe the word of the Living God ſaith it, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy, to which ye do well to take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Materia quae objecti rationem habet, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniter, quidem Dei verbum eſt, propriae ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro gratuitae promiſſiones in Chriſto fundatae. <hi>Wol.</hi> de fide ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis.</note> 
               <hi>until the day dawn, and the day Star ariſe in your hearts.</hi> Shee believes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of men no farther, than they concur with the clear and evident truth of the word of God; for as the Prophet ſaith, to the Law and to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Faith eyes the promiſes therein contained which relate unto and are founded in Chriſt,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:32632:185"/> as one ſaith the material cauſe of ſaving faith, (which may be termed an object) is commonly the Word of God, but properly the gracious promiſes founded in Chriſt. It is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. All the promiſes of God are in him, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Chriſt. Saith God, by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 43.25. <hi>I will blot out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for my one name ſake, and will not remember thy Sins.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes unto them.</hi> So that we ſee what God promiſeth in one place to do for his own name-ſake; in the other we find made good in Chriſt; promiſes of Peace, Pardon, Grace, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon the account of Chriſt; are the objects of a ſaving Faith. For indeed it is by laying the mouth of Faith to the breſt of the promiſes, that the Soul ſucks and draws nouriſhment by which it grows in grace; for had not Faith a promiſe of ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:32632:185"/> mercys, benefits and Priviledges to go to at all times, it would grow languid and decay; it would pine away. The promiſes by the aſſiſtance of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit keep Faith alive and active, vigorous and ſtrong, as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Father of the Faithful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15.20. <hi>He ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered or doubted, not at the promiſe of God, through unbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</hi> But how came he to be ſo ſtrong? but by Eying the Promiſe, and the power of that God that made it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>And being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,</hi> or knowing moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <hi>that what he had promiſed, he was able certainly to perform.</hi> It was the apprehention of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that held his head above water; ſo I ſay, if thy Faith be of a ſalvific and evangelic kind, it hath an Eye to the promiſes of God, which contain thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings made over through Chriſt to the Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, And that principally, it hath Chriſt for an object, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.21.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:32632:186"/> 
               <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He is the foundation for Faith to build upon, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundation can no man lay, then that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Goſpel throughout directs the Eye of Faith unto the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Looking unto Jeſus who is the Author and Finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Faith,</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo Loved the World, that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhall not Periſh but have everlasting Life.</hi> That is no ſaving Faith, which hath not an Eye to the Lord Jeſus. But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken more fully to this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſhall paſs it over, and come to the third particular, by which it may more evidently be diſcover'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, The nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of it do make it manifeſt. 1. It cleanſeth and puryfieth the heart: true Faith and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified Heart, are never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants, or coinhabitants, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>And put no difference
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:32632:186"/> between us and them, Purifying their Hearts by Faith.</hi> A defiled <hi>Gentile,</hi> as well as a choſen <hi>Jew,</hi> is puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, for Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the right means of purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Blood of Chriſt, it will not ſuffer corruption to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main predominant in the Soul; therefore the People of God, are ſaid to be a holy Temple, for the Holy God to dwell and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, It lifts the Heart above the World, and makes it come off Conquerer, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Whoſoever is Born of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the World, and this is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that the Lord Jeſus is the Son of God,</hi> Faith is a World-conquering Grace; it can preſentiate future things, it looks to the Land that is a far off, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.17. Faith cloaths the Soul with the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and gets the Moon of this World under his
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:32632:187"/> Feet, it regards theſe things, but as periſhing and tranſitory; the things of the future and ſempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal world to be moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Permanent and abiding. It was by Faith that all the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Champions of Chriſt, have conquered this Baſe World, and followed their Lord and Maſter, through the greateſt difficultys; I might inſtance in many; <hi>Moſes</hi> Refuſed all the Pomp and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Grandeur of the World, and made a voluntary choiſe of ſuffering with the People of God, and eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt, greater Riches then all the Riches of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but how did this valliant Conquerer break through all theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys? what could not Courts? nor Kingdoms? nor Terrors of a King? nor Treaſures? nor Horrors? nor Diſpleaſures? conquer one <hi>Moſes?</hi> ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as here was ſet in aray againſt him, the leaſt of which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to foil, if not to conquer
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:32632:187"/> the greateſt Monarch, if Faith be not his ſheild;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25., 26, 27.</note> but all theſe cords were too <hi>weak</hi> to hold him, whilſt the ſeven-fold Lock of Faith remained, his ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode firm, and his bow abode in ſtrength; it was by Faith he did all this, and there were two main Pillars, which ſupported him and his Faith; the firſt was looking to him who is inviſible, <hi>i. e.</hi> God. The ſecond was the proſpecting and looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I might number up many more Inſtances; but in ſhort, all the Servants of Chriſt have this conquering Faith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37.</note> for the nature of it, although one acts inferiour to another, by reaſon of the different degrees, ſome being not called to that tryal, as others are, but all have a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. <hi>Nay in all theſe things</hi> (ſpeaking of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of afflictions) <hi>we are more then Conquerers through him that Loved us.</hi> Every Chriſtian is to Fight the Fight of Faith and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:32632:188"/> Righteouſneſs; and in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat there is a conquerer, and the Conquered; either we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the World, or the World Conquers us; but if we come off Conquerers, it muſt be by the Shield of Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, It is a labouring working Faith, in oppoſition to an Idle Faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Seeſt thou how Faith wrought with his Work, and by Works was Faith made perfect?</hi> That is, by his works it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that his Faith was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and right Goſpel one; true Faith is opperative, it is active in puting the Soul upon all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto God; as it did <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in that difficult Service he was called to; by Faith he went through with it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was tryed offered his Son Iſaac.</hi> Faith put <hi>Noah</hi> upon his obedience unto God, when all others neglected their Salvation, and the Preach-of <hi>Noah</hi> unto them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>By Faith Noah being warned of God, of things not ſeen as yet, he being

            <p n="4">4ly, It is a Living Faith, it works a principal of Life in the Heart where it is wrought, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi>

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:32632:189"/> manifeſts how he lived; it was by a living Principle of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, apprehending a living Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, <hi>and Laſtly,</hi> It is a laſting and permanent, in oppoſition to a temporary and periſhing Faith: many pretend to believe, but it is for a time, like the Stony-ground Hearers, which rejoyce to day, and by reaſon of ſome afflictions are offended to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; but now true Faith is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding,<note place="margin">

Joy and exaltation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Now the God of Peace fill you with all Joy and Peace in believing.</hi> Joy is a Fruit that Grows upon the root of Faith; what hath made the Servants of Chriſt in all Ages <hi>Rejoice,</hi> when they met with nothing in the Inn of this World, but rough Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but their believing in Chriſt? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. tells the believers of the tryal of their Faith, and the preciouſneſs of it in the day of Chriſt, and ſaith in the 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> whom having not ſeen ye love, in whom though now ye ſee him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory. Faith aſſends by the wings of Love and Zeale, and fixeth it ſelf above the Clouds, and takes a view of the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:32632:190"/> 
               <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Glory of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhe takes a ſurvey of thoſe bleſſed immunities, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicitys, and that Immortal glory the Saints ſhall be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned and inveſted with, when they come to injoy Chriſt, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>all and in all, Col.</hi> 3.11. and from the bleſſed Proſpect of theſe things, Faith makes a return and deſcent into the Soul, implets and fills it with divine joy, even to the ſupream confines of it; it tells ſuch ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys of the Love of God and Chriſt and the bleſſed Spirit, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that it doth conflagate and inflame the Soul, and makes it rejoice perpetually in the Lord, according to that exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Apoſtle, rejoyce in the Lord always. May I ſpeak with reverence, Faith pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates into the very Boſome of the Almighty, and ſees there is Love, Peace, and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the believing Soul, it looks into the records of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and can read, <hi>Thy Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:32632:190"/> and thy Iniquitys are blotted out.</hi> It can look into the Lambs book of Life, and read the name of the believer, imprinted there; this makes the Soul exalt and triumph with Songs of praiſe; what made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> Sing and Rejoyce, when their Feet was incaſtriated, their Bodys with Stripes vulnerated,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 16.22, 23, 24, 25.</note> in an interior obſcure Priſon; deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſolace of that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is very ambitious of, <hi>ſcil.</hi> their Eyes to behold the Sun; but this a lively Faith, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated and fetched down new comfort to their Souls? Faith when Active, makes the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God and Chriſt, and in divine and ſpiritual objects.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Peace is another effect of that Faith which is wrought by the Spirit of God; as in that forequoted place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The God of Peace, fill you with all joy and Peace in believing.</hi> Peace of Conſcience from ſound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is a happy priviledge and great bleſſing. To be under the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:32632:191"/> racks of a diſquieted and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Conſcience, O what a mercy is it, to injoy peace and a Calm within the Soul, when there is nothing but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts and tumults abroad! what a comfortable condition is this? God hath made a promiſe of Peace to believers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3. <hi>I will keep him in Peace whoſe mind is Staid upon me, becauſe he truſteth in me.</hi> Chriſt gives his Peace to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as he did to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.27. <hi>My Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you.</hi> The Believer is at Peace with the Law of God, becauſe it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by the Death of Chriſt, at peace with God the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is well pleaſed in his Son, to be reconciled to poor Sinners, he is at peace with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf becauſe his Sins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he is never at peace again with Sin, or Satan, becauſe they are Enemys to this true Peace, which believers do partake of. The believers peace is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in Sin; but it is a peace
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:32632:191"/> from Sin, from the guilt and power of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, In thoſe who are come unto Chriſt, the Spirit hath wrought the grace of Love, for as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.8. <hi>He that Loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love.</hi> This is the great Goſpel-grace as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13.13.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jo.</hi> 13.35.</note> 
               <hi>Now there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth Faith, Hope and Love, theſe three, but the greateſt of theſe is Love.</hi> This is the diſtinguiſhing grace, by which we are known to be Chriſts Diſciples, it declares our Divine original, <hi>That we are Born from above,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.7. it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts our near union, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.16. <hi>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> But I ſhall ſpeak to this Query, how may one know, that the grace of Love is wrought by the Spirit in the Soul? The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of which may be known by theſe two means, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the propertys and objects of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the propertys of it,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:32632:192"/> it is Divine, for the Spirit of God is the Author of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.</note> it deſcends from above, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gifts, is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and cometh down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights.</hi> Now Love is one of theſe good &amp; perfect gifts,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.7.</note> for there is not any thing in the new Creature, which is not the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-work of God, all grace flows from him through Chriſt by his holy Spirit into the Soul; Love is a grace that is Immortal, for when Faith is turned into fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hope into poſſeſſion, this divine Love Remains,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Love never faileth.</hi> It is a Seed that never dies, a fire, that once being kindled, never more will be extinguiſhed; it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the Soul into the very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and makes it moſt like unto its maker, it is Divine, in that it Loves, Joys, and takes complacency in pure, holy, and divine objects; it is not Like Carnal Love which findes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the periſhing Creature to diligate and delight in; but
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:32632:192"/> it ſeeks better and more durable objects, becauſe it is of a Divine original, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Love is from God.</hi> Therefore there are reflex acts towards the Author and giver of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, This Love is ſublime, it is high and lofty (although not puffed up with vain pride) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſcorns to fix its felicity in a vain Periſhing world; the baſe things of this World are not objects noble enough for this excellent grace, it is of a noble extraction, and therefore Loves and delights in Divine and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects. <hi>David</hi> who was a Man after Gods own Heart, was full of this Divine and ſublime Love, therefore we have him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten expreſſing his Love to God, to the Law, far above Gold or Silver, or the periſhing traſh of a ſinful World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72. <hi>The Law of thy mouth is better to me then thouſands of Gold and Silver.</hi> The beauty of this inferior World, is but deformity and blackneſs, compared with the Splendor and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:32632:193"/> glory of thoſe divine objects, which this Love is fixed upon; the Honours and Riches of this World are but Dung and Droſs to the Soul, who hath this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Love, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Ye doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and count them but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> dogs-meat, that I may win Chriſt.</hi> What made the Apoſtle thus to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon theſe terrene things? and ſo to ſtain the glory of thoſe things which are moſt excellent in the Eyes of moſt men! why his Heart overflowed with this divine, ſublime, and ſeraphick Love; this is the true nature of evangelick Love, it Loves the World and the things of it, with a World-like Love, which is cold, indifferent, and mutable; the Heart that flows with this Love ever ebbs and runs low to the things of this world, becauſe it looks upon them as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of its Love.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:32632:193"/>3ly, It Loves ſuperlatively all divine things; it doth not only Love in a high degree, but in the higheſt, even with all the Heart, with all the Mind, and with all the Strength; God and Chriſt are to be beloved beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as one ſaith, the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Loving God, is,<note place="margin">Modus dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendi deum eſt ut dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum poteſt diligi. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note> that he may be beloved as much as he can be beloved. This evangellick Love ſeats it ſelf in the moſt ſuperlative place of the Soul; there is no compariſon between this Love and the Love of the Creature.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, This Love is ſincere. <hi>Grace be with all thoſe who Love the Lord Jeſus in Sincerity, Eph.</hi> 6.24. If there is not Sincerity at the Root, beſure the Fruit is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; Hypocriſie is the diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many, but Sincerity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and Uprightneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the Soul; wherefore were <hi>Noah, Job,</hi> and others count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perfect? it was not becauſe they were Perfect in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but becauſe their Love
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:32632:194"/> was Sincere; this makes the Scripture give ſuch an excellent Charactor of them. Sincerity is (as it were the Salt which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons every duty) and a Sincere Love (although but weak in the actings) is that which ſavours of a right Goſpel Spirit.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, It is a fervent Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Fervent in Spirit, Serving the Lord.</hi> It is true that this Love may not always, Seraphin like, be in a bright burning flame; but yet where once it is wrought by the Spirit, it never after is quite extinguiſhed; for when it flames not it does burn, and when it burns not clearly, there are ſome ſcintilla's and Sparks, which keep it from quite going out; and when the Cinders of Corruption are blown away, it kindles up into a flame again. Let one who hath this fervent Love through invigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy fall into Sin, or neglect duty, it cools and damps the fire of his affection for a time; but let him come again to the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:32632:194"/> and by Faith Drink a draught of the warm Blood of Chriſt, and by Prayer blow up the heat of his affections; it will prove but like the Water the Smith Caſts upon the fire, which ſeemingly Puts it out, but when he hath blown a while, it flames more violently, I ſay not this to incourage any to make tryal by Sin; but if it be ſo with any, that now find their Love but cold which formerly was fervent, they may ſee the cauſe, &amp; be wiſe to improve and apply the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; this Love I ſay is Ardent Love, which warms the heart, for it is a ray from the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which ſets the Soul all in a Divine feaver.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly, This Love is total; I mean, it is with the whole heart. <hi>God hates a divided Heart,</hi> or as the Hebrew hath it, <hi>a Heart and a Heart;</hi> one as it were for God, and another for the World and Sin, but God will have the whole or none; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:32632:195"/> God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5.</note> 
               <hi>with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind.</hi> See here how many Times <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; as God is of an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible eſſence, ſo he would not have that which is his due to be divided; now the true Saint is very well content that God ſhould have all; he would have none to be Copartner with God and Chriſt, but deſires that his Love and affections may whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be fixed and ſet upon the right objects; when God ſaith to the perſon who hath this Love, my Son, give me thy heart, he is ready to reſpond, and ſay, Lord here am I, take the whole of my heart; nay, take the all of my all, let me be but thine and that for ever.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly <hi>and laſtly,</hi> It is a conſtant and permanent Love; as Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Continue ye in my love;</hi> ſo may I ſay to you, <hi>See that this love abide and continue in you;</hi> For if your Love be of an Evangellick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a permanent Love, 1
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:32632:195"/> 
               <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Love never faileth;</hi> Chriſt ſpake of ſome whoſe Love ſhould fail them, but that which is durable ends in Salvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12.13. <hi>Becauſe Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall abound, the Love of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall wax cold, but he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved;</hi> He whoſe Love keeps warm and abideth, ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain Salvation, as the love of God towards his People is an everlaſting love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. So he expects that their love ſhould be a permanent love. God hates thoſe who draw back, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. but it is the nature of this love to preſs forward, to increaſe and aſpire till it comes unto the Center, from whence it came. He that hath this love maintains it in adverſity, as well as proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; when the Clouds do darken the Face of God, as well as when the Sun-ſhine of this love, beams forth upon the Soul; many of the Saints have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced this; they have found their love hotteſt, when their
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:32632:196"/> afflictions have been heavyeſt when moſt ſhaken by the World, they have been moſt confirmed in their love to God and Chriſt. I come now to the objects of this ſpiritual evangelick love, and I ſhall ſpeak of them firſt negatively, ſhewing what are not the objects of this love. 2ly, poſſitively, what they are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively, what are not the objects. 1. Not Sin neither in ones ſelf or in another. The Soul that hath this Divine love in it cannot but hate all Sin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.101. and 104. <hi>I have refrained my feet from every evil way,</hi> v. 104. <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> v. 113. <hi>I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I love.</hi> As God is ſaid to be <hi>of purer Eies then to behold Iniquity;</hi> ſo the Saints are of purer Hearts then to love Iniquity; Sin hath brought bitterneſs to their ſouls, therefore they now abhor it, they have no love or liking at all for Sin; it doth not fix upon Iniquity, as a delectable and lovely object, but hates and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:32632:196"/> flees from all baſe luſts which ſeek to inſnare the Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, It is not fixed upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, for although no Creature, mearly as a Creature, is to be the object of our hatred, becauſe it declares ſomething of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power of the Creator, in giving exiſtence and being to ſuch a Creature; yet Satan in his Sinful lapſed State, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as an Enemy to God, Chriſt, and the well being of our immortal Souls, ought to be the object of our hatred, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>For he goes about like a Roaring lyon ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> He makes it his great imployment to effect the ruin of poor Souls, therefore he is become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of hatred.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, It is not placed upon this te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rene, dying, and periſhing world; love to God and Chriſt, in that meaſure and degree as it ſhould be; cannot conſiſt with an eager and earneſt love of the world, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ye Adulterers, and Adultereſſes, know ye not that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:32632:197"/> the Friendſhip of the World is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with God? whoſoever therefore will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of God.</hi> This is further manifeſt in 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the World, neither the things of the World, for if any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him.</hi> Here the divine Apoſtle gives a reaſon, which withal proves that theſe two are not conſiſtent; for as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Luk</hi> 16.13. <hi>You cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> one will have the preheminence; and where this true evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Love is, there the Love to the World is but flat and cold.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, And poſſitively, what are the true adequate and conſtant objects of this Evangellick Love in general, all ſpiritual divine &amp; holy objects, to which our Love is commanded or required by the Holy Word of God; there is nothing which the believer apprehends to be truely divine, but the Soul Loves entirely, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, and conſtantly; for theſe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:32632:197"/> objects are ſutable to the State of a Believer: he can perceive a greater excellence in them, then in any other; therefore the Soul is carried forth to love them above all others: but more particularly, and yet ſuccinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is the object of this Evangellic Love; he is the chief and ſupream good, therefore ſupreamly to be beloved; even <hi>with all the heart, with all the Soul, and with all the ſtrength,</hi> Mat. 22.37. The Soul that is come to Chriſt by believing in him, loves God not only as a Creator, but as a reconciled Father, in and through Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. Now it looks upon it ſelf as oblieg'd and bound to love God who hath manifeſted ſuch Love,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.</note> as to give his only begotten Son, that whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life: if God out of his infinite love had not been willing to give his Son to die for Sinners, Chriſt would not have been willing to come, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:32632:198"/> give himſelf for, and to thoſe who are his. The Father out of his Love elected ſome to be <hi>Heirs of God, and Co-heirs with Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.17. Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe things doth inflame the heart with Love to God, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> The fruits and effects of the Love of God, ſhed abroad in the Soul, makes it now to love God with an impartial and ſuperlative Love;<note place="margin">Modus dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendi Deum eſt ſine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note> it Loves God (as one ſaith the meaſure of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him ſhould be) without meaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Chriſt Jeſus is the object of this Love. O how the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever loves Chriſt! the Soul is ſo fired with Love to the Lord Jeſus, that it knows not how to expreſs it: words are too mean, actions too low, and the Soul thinks all too little to expreſs and manifeſt its Love unto the Lord Jeſus. When the Believer conſiders Chriſt in the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellency of his perſon;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:32632:198"/> that he is God bleſſed for ever; that he is the Eternal Son of God, beloved of him, adored of Angels; then he ſays with the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>My beloved is the chiefeſt among ten thouſand:</hi> and as it is in the 16. verſ. <hi>He is altogether lovely.</hi> Further, when he conſiders the extremity, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs, and ignominy of the Paſſion and Suffering Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent for him, and that he ſhould expreſs his Love at ſo dear a rate to one altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving; it doth ſo inflame the Soul, that it vehemently longs to get above the clouds into the boſom of Jeſus; and that it may drink of the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fountain and Springs of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.17. Moreover, when it conſiders what Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and what he is doing now for his Elect and Redeemed ones; that he hath procured Pardon, Reconciliation with God, Grace, and Glory, Life, and eternal Bliſs; for thoſe who were <hi>ſometimes dead in Treſpaſſes
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:32632:199"/> and Sins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4.</note> 
               <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. and that he continues interceeding by the vertue of his Blood and Merits, that all his may have theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings confered upon them, and at laſt be crowned with a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of Righteouſneſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. O the conſideration of theſe things doth ſo incendiate the Soul with the flames of Divine Love, that many waters cannot quench it, neither can floods drown it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7. nay, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Perſecutions, or Death, cannot ſeperate this Soul from the Love of Chriſt. When the Believer looks upon Chriſt, in his Offices, and in that near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between them; this doth ſtill elevate and heighten his Love; ſo that the Soul is full, and as it were, immerged and ſwallowed up with Love to Chriſt, who is the Head and the all of Believers, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, This Divine Evangelick Love, hath for its object the holy Spirit; he who is the alone Author, is now become the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:32632:199"/> the Spirit is he who infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and operateth this grace in the Soul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit is Love:</hi> now, ſeeing this is a Fruit of the Spirit, it has reflex actings; ſo that it leads the Soul to love affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and intirely the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, knowing that except he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operates, nothing can profit the Soul, and that if he work not,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.15.</note> there will be no exception of grace; it is he which leads and guides into the way of all truth, which is the alone way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he teacheth the Soul to know God and Chriſt, and to know it ſelf: he fills the heart with Divine bleſſings, which make the Believer greatly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and love him. Try your Love by theſe objects; ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Carnal or Divine objects have the Supremacy in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; for theſe are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ways to try your Love by, and to diſcern a true Evangelic Love from all others whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:32632:200"/>4ly, Holy Angels are greatly beloved of Believers, becauſe they are to be their Companions to Eternity, and bear part in that Celeſtial quire, where they ſhall ſing eternal Hallelujahs to their God and Father in <hi>the Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, Heb.</hi> 12.28. and further, becauſe they are a Life-guard to them here, and <hi>Miniſtring Spirits ſent forth for the good of all thoſe who are Heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly, All Saints as ſuch, are the objects of this Divine Love, without any diſtinction or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Becauſe they perceive their Fathers Image ſhine forth in ſuch; therefore that which is ſo amiable in them, doth attract and draw their affection to it. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces puts this down as a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, by which we may prove our Love if it be right; nay, the only way to know whether we Love God or no, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20. <hi>If a man ſay I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Lyar; for he who
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:32632:200"/> loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 3. <hi>O my Soul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord, my goodneſs extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints that are in the Earth, and to the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.</hi> Here this holy man declares that the Saints were excellent in his eye, and all the delight of his Soul; but why were they ſo? but becauſe they were <hi>Saints,</hi> they were <hi>holy ones, born from above,</hi> and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the moſt high.</p>
            <p n="6">6ly, Faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel, in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have an intereſt in this love. The perſons that have this right love, cannot but eſteem of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and love them becauſe they are Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Embaſſadors ſent from God for the good of their Souls 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled unto

Obedience in theſe things is a great demonſtration of a real and ſincere Love. 2. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the high eſtimation of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Let the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that rule well, be counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour in the word and Doctrine.</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Maximè</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, thoſe who are laborious in preaching the Doctrines of the Goſpel; it is evident that we do not love that perſon, who we eſteem not according to his deſerts and degree. 3. In allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a chearful and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent maintenance, according to the capacity of them over whom the Lord hath ſet them, to feed them in the way to life eternal.</p>
            <p n="7">7ly. The objects of the Love are the word of God and his Commandments; and this is a certain rule to try thy Love by; for if a perſon ſhould propoſe this Queſtion to me, how may I do to know whether I have a true Evangellic Love which is a fruit of the Spirit of God? I would anſwer, <hi>by this, See</hi> if you love the Commandments and the word of God; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5.3. <hi>By this we know, we are the Children of God, if we love God, and keep his Commandments; he that loveth me
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:32632:203"/> not, keepeth not my ſayings;</hi> Here we may clearly and evidently perceive that a Love to the Commandments doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our Love to God and Chriſt to be real, and if it be ſo, then we may conclude that it will never fail, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. But will indure for ever. How did <hi>David</hi> declare himſelfe to be a man after Gods own heart; but by this, in expreſſing the greatneſs of his Love to the law of God? as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72.97. verſ. 163. <hi>O how I love thy Law, it is my Meditation all the day long, I love it above Gold and ſilver.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. But how few <hi>Davids</hi> are there! How few are there of his Spirit to be found in the World! on the contrary, moſt trample under foot the Law of God; and eſteem Gold, and traſh, and Luſts above it; but yet the true believer and diſciple of Chriſt doth greatly love that holy law; and with the Apoſtle, <hi>delights in it after the inward man, Rom.</hi> 7.22.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:32632:203"/>8ly, This Love has <hi>Souls for its objects.</hi> As it was the greatneſs of Chriſts Love to Souls (next to the obedience to his Fathers will) which brought him from Heaven to Earth, and made him willing to deveſt himſelf of his glory, and take upon him the form of a Servant.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8.</note> So they who have this Love of Chriſt wrought in their Souls by the holy Spirit, are vehemently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with Love and deſire after the good of Souls. He that in ſome meaſure apprehends what a great thing 'tis to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, cannot but deſire the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all others. If upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry you find no ſenſible and real Love to Souls, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is but little of this grace of Love within you. The perſon in whoſe heart this grace is implanted, pants after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his own Soul, and the Souls of his Relations, Friends, and acquaintance. It may be ſaid of them, as it is of God,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:32632:204"/> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>They would have all men be ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth.</hi> What was it that made the Apoſtles and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt in all Ages ſuffer ſo much, and yet willingly? It was theſe two Principles. <hi>First,</hi> their Love to Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>For the Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us. Secondly,</hi> their zealous love and deſire of the everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Immortal Souls; they were willing (according to that Scripture) to lay down their Lives for the good of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Believers. Now ſee if your Love be ſuch that you earneſtly deſire the well being of the Souls of thoſe who are about you, or related to you.</p>
            <p n="9">9ly, The objects of this Love are all the inſtitutions of Chriſt. O how lovely are his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to his beloved ones! Prayer is Lovely and aimable becauſe it is the Key that unlocks the Gates of Heaven, and opens the very Boſome of God, ſo that he is ready to confer plentiful trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:32632:204"/> of grace upon this divine Lover; hearing of Gods word is delectable to ſuch an one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein the Love, glory, and Tranſcendent excellencys of Chriſt are diſplayed, and the will of the Father clearly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Soul, and thence the Soul derives &amp; finds grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated out of the fulneſs of Chriſt, becauſe it is the means of conveyance; the Sacraments are amiable, becauſe they are Seals of Heaven, by which God makes over himſelf and all to believers, &amp; aſſures them of the ſtability, faithfulneſs, and everlaſtingneſs of his Love, in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the believer by Faith beholds Chriſt broken and bleeding for his Sins, and it becomes nouriſhment to the Soul; in it the Soul injoys communion with God, Chriſt, and Bleſſed Saints; theſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges render the ordinances ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lovely &amp; delectable to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. I might run through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as Reading, Meditating,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:32632:205"/> and holy conferrence which are all very lovely to the Evangellic Lover.</p>
            <p n="10">10ly, <hi>and laſtly,</hi> Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs theſe bare ſo much of God in them, that the Apoſtle calls them the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given to us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and pretious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that by theſe you might be partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Divine Nature, having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped the corruption that is in the World through Luſt.</hi> Grace hath a lovely aſpect, and holyneſs ſhines forth like a Beam of Heaven in the Eyes of them whoſe Hearts are full of Love to Divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; Grace and Holyneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Image of God, and the way and means through Chriſt to Heaven and happineſs, are intirely beloved; the Divine Lover is ſo enamoured with the excellency and true worth of Grace, that he eſteems it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all terrene objects; and the Soul wiſheth nothing more than to be full even to the brim,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16.</note> with this celeſtial Liquor. And
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:32632:205"/> for Holyneſs the Soul is ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to attain to the perfection of it, <hi>To be Holy as God is Holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> But ſeeing it cannot acquire that Perfection in this Life, it is ſo in Love with Sanctity, that it pants and Prays, and longs to get to that ſtate of Glory, wherein it is not perfecting, but perfect in Holyneſs; not cleanſing, but cleanſed and purified from all Iniquitys. By theſe things you may know whether the Spirit hath wrought the Grace of love in your Souls.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, The Fourth grace is Hope; This is numbred among the three graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. <hi>And now abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity, but the greateſt of theſe is Charity.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to this and the other two, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Zeale very Briefly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have been longer then I intended in the former, the Spirit is the Author of this evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellick grace in the Soul; and it is the Character of the People
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:32632:206"/> of God, that they are thoſe who hope in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Be of good Courage and he ſhall ſtrengthen your Hearts all ye that hope in the Lord.</hi> 1. I ſhall declare what this Hope is. 2. Its Nature and Office. 3. Its objects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is: Hope is a Grace of the Soul whereby eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Chriſtian doth ſurely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and patiently wait and look for the injoyment of promiſed mercys and Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24.25. <hi>For we are ſaved by Hope, but hope that is ſeen, is no hope, for how can a Man hope for that which he ſeeth? but if we hope for that we ſee not, we do with patience wait for it,</hi> Heb. 10.35.36. <hi>Caſt not away therefore your Confidence which hath great recompence of reward.</hi> Verſ. 36. <hi>For ye have need of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the Promiſe, i. e.</hi> The thing promiſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.</hi> Hope looks to the time to come, for the certain poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the thing hoped for.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:32632:206"/>2. The propertys of it. 1. It Looks for the thing promiſed; God hath promiſed Life, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Glory, and Bliſs to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot lye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, before the world began.</hi> I will give Grace and Glory ſaith God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. Now hope doth firmly expect that God ſhould make good his word; and not fail in one Iota or tittle of all things he hath promiſed to his Saints and Servants. 2. It is the nature of it to look forwards to the end, and full perfection of bliſs. Here our bleſſedneſs is but imperfect, becauſe our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not compleated (there being the Reliques of Sin in the Soul,) but hereafter, when we are taken above the Clouds, and poſſeſſed of eternal Glory, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in full fruition of God) Grace ſhall be perfected and Crowned with Glory, Faith ſhall be turned into a glorious viſion, and hope into everlaſting fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this hope expects and waits
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:32632:207"/> for. 3. From the conſideration and certain perſwaſion of the things hoped for, it fills the Soul with joy and gladneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. Rejoycing in the Hope of the Glory of God. The very Expectation that the Day will come, when the Soul ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with, and poſſeſs <hi>That far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory,</hi> ſpoken of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. makes it even in the midſt of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions exult and rejoice. It can Glory in tribulation when the Heart is poſſeſt of this Grace of Hope. 4. This Hope is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to diſcover it ſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it make the Perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed that has it. <hi>Paul</hi> is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to own it before <hi>Agrippa</hi> and a Court of Judicature, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.6. <hi>And now I ſtand and am Judged, for the Hope of the promiſe made by God to our Fathers.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the worldly Miſer may condemn Believers, who build ſo much upon the expectation of future happineſs; and for that are willing to undergo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:32632:207"/> here; <hi>Yet this hope mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not aſhamed, becauſe the Love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart by the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 5.5. 5. It puts the Soul upon purification of it ſelf. Seeing it expects ſuch great things, as to be delivered from all evil to enjoy God, and be made like unto him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2.3. <hi>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when we ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>And every man that hath this hope in him, purifyeth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> This Soul expects to live with a holy God, holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Saints, therefore it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to become holy, and to be made meet for ſo bleſſed an Inheritance, as God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them who hope in his Mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly, The objects and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Evangelic hope. 1. God, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul, and why art thou diſquieted within me,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:32632:208"/> hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him for the help of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi> So verſ. 11. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.5. The Pſalmiſt doth ſtill call upon his Soul to hope in God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is.</hi> 2. This hope builds upon the Mercy of God in and through Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.1.8. <hi>Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his Mercy.</hi> And in the 147. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in thoſe that fear him, in them that hope in his Mercy.</hi> God has declared himſelf by this Name, <hi>The Lord gracious and merciful, Exod.</hi> 34.6. therefore hope looks unto this, expecting that his Mercy and pity will move him to tender forth grace to the poor ſoul. Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Mercy promiſed to the Fathers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.72. <hi>To perform the Mercy promiſed to our Fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant;</hi> And the fulfilling of this is ſaid to flow from the tender mercys
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:32632:208"/> of God, ver. 78. <hi>Through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercys of God, whereby the day ſpring from on high hath viſited us,</hi> ſo that hope takes incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the mercy of God ſtill to rely upon him.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. The faithfulneſs of God, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before the foundation of the world;</hi> Here the ſoul caſts An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, flyes to refuge in ſtorms, and concludes the foundation of God ſtands ſure,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13.19.</note> and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himſelfe; he can as ſoon ceaſe to be, as fail of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling his promiſes, which he has given as bonds to his people, and they are ſealed with the blood of Chriſt, therefore never to be cancelled till they are fully diſcharged.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. This hope looks upon the promiſes that God hath made, and builds upon them. 1. for ſalvation and eternal life; the believer firmly hopes for it, and expects to partake of life and happineſs; as in that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:32632:209"/> place, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye, hath promiſed.</hi> So ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16.36. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life, Jo.</hi> 10.28. <hi>I will give unto them eternal life;</hi> Now God and Chriſt having promiſed this, the believer hopes for the performance of it. 2ly. Promiſes of glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4.17. and in many other places. Therefore theſe ſublime and eternal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, this hope is fixed upon; not upon the baſe vanitys of this periſhing world; not upon the promiſes of men or Angells; but upon the promiſes of God in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>All the promiſes of God are in Chriſt, yea and amen, to the praiſe of his glory;</hi> Therefore it being for his praiſe and glory, he will fully perform
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:32632:209"/> and not diſappoint the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any who hope and truſt in him.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly. The ſpirit hath wrought the grace of humility. This grace is moſt lovely in the eyes of God and men; nay, it is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and amiable, that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who themſelves are lofty cannot but admire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this beautiful adornment, when they behold it in others. It is ſo tranſcendent and comely, that the great God takes delight to dwell with ſuch Souls, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>For thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of an humble and contrite Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus was not aſhamed to be cloathed with this garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Spirit.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts believers to put on this compleat Robe of humility,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:32632:210"/> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Be cloathed with humility.</hi> I ſhall ſhow in a few particulars how it may be known, whether this Grace be wrought in the Heart or no. 1. Where this grace is, there is contriteneſs of Spirit. A broken heart and an humble heart go together; ſo in that place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>To revive the Spirit of the humble, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Heart of the contrite ones.</hi> and in the 66. Chap. 2. verſ. <hi>But to this Man will I Look, even to him that is of a poor and contrite Spirit.</hi> Therefore brokenneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition are ſometimes put for a truely humble frame, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken heart, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not diſpiſe.</hi> 2ly, The perſon who hath this Grace, hath ſelf-debaſing thoughts of himſelf. When on the contrary, the Proud Spirit doth elevate and lift up it ſelf, it hath high thoughts (although altogether undeſerving) of it ſelf; the humble perſon thinks all to much that is conferred
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:32632:210"/> upon him, when any Praiſe and commend him (though he true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerves it) yet he hath ſuch mean thoughts of himſelf, that he concludes, they have out of extream Love, or Flattery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the bounds of his merits; but now the ſuperbious and lofty, imagin every one is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and comes ſhort of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to him according to his worth and deſerts. <hi>Abſolon,</hi> thinks he hath not Honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in being the Kings Son, but he muſt ſtand in the Gate, and by all means be made King in the room of his Father; when humble <hi>David</hi> looked upon it as a great matter to be only Son in Law to a King; ſee how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth his humility, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.23. <hi>And</hi> Sauls <hi>Servants ſpake thoſe Words in the Ears of</hi> David; <hi>and</hi> David <hi>ſaid, ſeemeth it unto you a Light thing to be a Kings Son in Law, ſeeing that I am a poor man and lightly eſteemed.</hi> Thus we ſee that Pride is ambitious of exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; when humility lays it

This Zeale leads the Soul to be
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:32632:214"/> Zealous for Chriſt. O how Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous were the Apoſtles and all the faithful Servants of Chriſt, when they broke through all difficultys to exalt Chriſt, and keep Faithful to him. All the Waters of affliction could not quench this Zeal, neither could the Scorching Flames conſume it; the threats and edicts of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemys, could not at all cool the heat of this Zeal, but rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Fuel to the Fire, and made it burn more vehemently. What made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo reſolute when he heard what was prophecied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, if he went up to <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 21.11, 12, 13.

            <p n="4">4ly, It is a Zeal according to knowledge; There is much blind and ignorant Zeal abroad in the World; ſuch as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

            <p n="5">5ly, <hi>and laſtly,</hi> It is a Zeal for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things and gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.<note place="margin">

            <p>There is ſtill a uſe of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that remains under this point of Doctrine, that <hi>It is the indiſpenſable duty of all labouring and heavy laden Sinners (who look for reſt and Salvation) to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Jeſus, that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</hi> And if it is a duty (as hath been proved) then let me exhort all to come; for if you do neglect or refuſe to come, you do neglect your dutys, and ſlight your Souls, and refuſe the only means of eternal Salvation. But here you may be ready to make this queſtion, how muſt I come unto the Lord Jeſus that I may obtain reſt and ſalvation? In anſwering of this queſtion, I ſhall take in the third Doctrine, becauſe I have already exceeded my firſt intentions, &amp; ſhall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the fourth by way of motive
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:32632:215"/> and incouragement; becauſe I obſerve poor ſinners are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very unwilling to come to Chriſt; they had rather weary themſelves, and labour under their burthens of ſin, till they are in the end cruſhed down with the intolerable pondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of eternal vengeance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, if thou wouldſt come unto Chriſt aright, pray for the holy Spirit, that he may inable thee to come to Chriſt in that way which will certainly end in reſt and Salvation; for as I have before declared, it is the Spirit that illuminates the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all thoſe things which are neceſſary to Salvation; it is that convinceth the conſcience of thoſe dutys which abſolutely concern the Soul; he inclines the will to comply readily with the whole, known, and reveal'd will of God; he ſanctifys the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and works grace in the Soul; all theſe are his works alone, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:32632:216"/> is not oblieged to any means or method; yet the means, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, depend wholly upon his Energy and Co-operation; therefore if thou wouldſt come to Chriſt aright, pray heartily, and ſeek fervently for the holy Spirit, without whoſe conduct thou canſt never come to Chriſt effectually, and ſo as to be eaſed of thy Burthens.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, When thou haſt ſought for the Spirit, and doſt feel him working upon thy Soul, then come unto Chriſt as labouring under the intollerable Burthen of ſin; for ſin is a heavy burthen, although multitudes in the world count it light, as may be ſeen by their chearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, merry hearts, jovial lives, and running and drawing under this burthen into Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being very little concerned for the weight of it.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:32632:221"/> of this reſt; which leads me to the Motives that may induce us freely and chearfully to come unto Chriſt, and they ſhall be taken from the conſideration of what kind of reſt this is, which Chriſt will give unto them that come unto him. 1. In regard of this World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſhall be a reſt from the Dominion of Sin, and I think it is a happy reſt and priviledge to be free from the dominion of Sin; if it was only this reſt that ſhould be obtained, it would be very well worth coming unto Chriſt, for who would be a ſlave and ſervant to Sin,<note place="margin">Humano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nullum eſt grave malorum niſi Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. <hi>Chriſoſt.</hi>
               </note> which brings trouble and vexation of Spirit; now thoſe the Son makes free, they are free indeed, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8.34, 35, 36. <hi>Whoſoever commiteth Sin, is the Servant of Sin, and the Servant abideth not in the houſe for ever; but the Son abideth ever, if the Son therefore ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> It is Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that can make any free from the raigning power of Sin;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:32632:221"/> therefore come unto him that thou mayeſt partake of this Bleſſedneſs, not to be a Servant of Sin, whilſt thou art here; it is a baſe ſervitude and very diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, moſt uncomfortable, and hath the leaſt and worſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; for he that is Servant to Sin, hath abundance of Enemys, but no real Friends; therefore he is obnoctious to miſerys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment, both temporal and eternal.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, It is a Reſt from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Satan, although not from his temptations &amp; Snares: whilſt thou abideſt in this ſinful world, and art a ſojourner as all thy Fathers were the Devil will hunt and tempt thee to commit Iniquity; but yet if thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unto Chriſt, he will give thee reſt from the tiranical power of this grand enemy, for he will do and ſay unto thee as he did unto <hi>Paul</hi> when buffered by the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan, <hi>My Grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee for my ſtrength is made perfect in thy weakneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:32632:222"/> And if thou haſt the ſtrength of Chriſt for thee, although thou art weak in thy ſelf, <hi>Yet thou wilt be ſtrong to reſiſt Satan,</hi> Verſ. 10. of that <hi>Chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3ly. It is an inward Soul-reſt that thou ſhalt have if thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unto him, it is not ſuch a Reſt as the world gives, neither can the World deprive thee of it, the World may afflict, and perplex thy outward man, and give no reſt unto it; but it can never touch thy internal peace &amp; reſt, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> is pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it upon thee; if thou haſt <hi>reſt</hi> for thy Soul, thou art moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py even in the midſt of Worldly diſquietments; for it is the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and trouble of the Soul, that is the Soul of affliction; but now Chriſt hath promiſed to give this Soul-reſt to thoſe that come unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Spirit, and ye ſhall find reſt for your Souls.</hi> This indeed is the beſt of reſts; for ſuppoſe a man hath never ſo
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:32632:222"/> many temporal injoyments, yet if his Soul be not at reſt and peace, all theſe bleſſings ſeem to be curſed to him; becauſe his Soul is under preturbations, or if not ſo, yet under ſleepy ſinful ſecurity, which is worſe; but O the ſerene calmneſs, peace, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateneſs that the ſaints injoy in this life; for I am not ſpeaking of that reſt the Righteous ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit hereafter; but whilſt we are here in the Wilderneſs and journy to <hi>Canaan;</hi> God hath promiſed to give them peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3. Whoſe minds are ſtayed upon him; and the Saints expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience this dayly.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. What kind of peace and reſt this is in regard of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture World. 1. It is a true reſt, not any fiction of the Poets, but a certain and firm reſt; that Chriſt hath purchaſed for,<note place="margin">Non expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctationem fallit.</note> and promiſed to believers, they ſhall be ſure of it, for he that cannot lye hath promiſed it; he who is the Amen, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14. He in whoſe mouth was found
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:32632:223"/> no guile, therefore he will not deceive poor Souls, for <hi>The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Men many times promiſe themſelves reſt, but it proves falſe to them, for the moſt part, and they never find that reſt which they imagined would be their lot: but now this reſt will prove true even beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. 2. The reſt that Chriſt will give to them that come unto him, ſhall be perfect and compleat reſt: it is not part reſt, and other part trouble; it is not only for the Soul, but for the body too; the Saints are in this life <hi>Compleat in Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2.10.

            <p n="3">3ly. A holy reſt; for there is no unclean thing enters into that reſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.17. <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither that worketh abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:32632:223"/> or maketh a Lye, but they which are written in the Lambs book of Life.</hi> It is the place and ſeat of the holy God, and there are none but holy Angels and Saints, to attend the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who inhabits this holy Place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>For thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe name is holy.

            <p n="4">4ly, It is a glorious reſt, and who is able to expreſs the Glory of it? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light afflictions which are but for a moment, worke for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> Hyperbolies of Glory, far tranſcending our ſhallow Capacitys and weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: it is a participating of the ſame Glory with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>If Children, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt: if ſo be we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with him, that we may alſo be Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together.</hi> It is a glorious reſt in theſe reſpects. 1.

There are none but Glorified Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are inhahitants of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Pallace, attending always upon the Lord the great <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, and Cherubims ſurround his Throne, ſinging forth his magnificent Glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1.2. 3. <hi>Crying out, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> And Glorified Saints they are at this work, extolling and magnifying the great God, <hi>Rev</hi> 4.10.11. and in the 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> They are ſinging forth Halelujah, Salvation, and Honour, and Glory, and Power, unto the Lord our God. 3. It is a Glorious Reſt in reſpect that the Saints ſhall have a glorious view of the beatifical viſion. They ſhall behold the Glorious God, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.2. <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Here no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Eye can behold him and Live; but there all Clouds ſhall be diſipated, the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:32632:224"/> Curtains drawn a ſide, the viſion ſhall be perſpicuous; here we ſee but in a Glaſs darkly, but then Face to Face. 4ly, It is a Glorious reſt in this, that the Saints are not only bleſſed with the viſion of this Glory, but they have glory conferred upon them all: they do not only ſee him, but are <hi>made like unto him.</hi> They ſhall all Raign as Kings and Princes for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. and 4.10. Here the Saints are looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as contemptible Creatures, and the World hates them, and for the moſt Part tramples them under foot, but Chriſt will confer ſuch a Glorious reſt upon them, that they ſhall be exalted above their Enemys, and ſhall Raign with him in Glory, and that to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which leads me to the laſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and that is this, that this Reſt which Chriſt will give to all them that come unto him, and accept of him, is fiftly, and laſtly, an everlaſting Reſt, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo ſhall ever be with the Lord.</hi> Indeed this is the Crown and Happyneſs of all, that it ſhall be to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, not for a day, a year, or thou ſands of years, but as long as God is, and Chriſt is, which will be for ever, ſo long ſhall the Saints inherit and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs Glory, therefore it is called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Glory, and eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To them who by Patient continuing in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:32632:225"/> well doing, ſeek for Honour, and Glory, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity, and eternal Life.</hi> O the ſweetneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort that is in the word Eternal to all thoſe that believe Moſt People would think themſelves happy, if they could have Tabernacles of reſt built for them whilſt they are in this World, which very rarely exceeds the time of threeſcore years and Ten, but what is this comparable to that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of Reſt prepared for the Saints, when they ſhall be taken up to live with Chriſt for ever. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is a Lyer when he promiſeth Reſt, for he can never give it. The World is continually attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with preturbations, dſiquietneſs, or at the beſt, with an imperfect Reſt, but thoſe who cloſe with Chriſt ſhall injoy an everlaſting and perpetual Reſt; and what greater motive can there be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce poor Sinners who here are in continual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and wearying themſelves under heavy and intollerable burthens? it is moſt certain that there is no reſt, (that will comfort the Soul) to be found out of Chriſt; it is he that can give reſt unto the weary, it is he that hath purchaſed reſt for the Labouring and heavy Laden; and withal, he condeſcends to invite, and has promiſed that thoſe who come and believe in him ſhall have a reſt from the dominion of Sin, from the Tyranny of Satan, and a Soul-Reſt in this Life, and alſo they ſhall have a true and perfect, a holy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reſt, and in fine, an eternal Reſt, which adds exceedingly to the felicity of the Saints, therefore as I began, ſo I ſhall conclude with the words of the Lord Jeſus, (varying the Perſon) <hi>Come unto him all ye that Labour, and are heavy Laden, and he will give you Reſt.</hi>
